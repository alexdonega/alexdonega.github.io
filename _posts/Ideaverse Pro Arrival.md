Welcome to this ideaverse by Linking Your Thinking. 

![[pillars-of-ideaverse-8-bit-narrow.png]]

It's no accident the internet brought you here. In our age of information overwhelm, we find ourselves lost in everyone’s thoughts but our own. The result is real, felt pain. I've been there. I've also discovered that building a well-connected inner world of thoughts and ideas solves for this pain. 

Linking your thinking is the solution. Simply by linking your notes to other notes, you are building your own **ideaverse:** ***a digital ecosystem of ideas.*** While the internet serves our outer world, an ideaverse nourishes our inner world. But both are powered by the same energy source: links. 

That's where Ideaverse Pro is here to help you harness this power. If you take the time to go through this ideaverse, it will affect your thinking in immediately practical ways, but also, in less obvious but deeply profound ways, because it will change how you approach your relationship with information itself. Good luck. Now, let's get oriented.

# Orient yourself 

This ideaverse is deceptively big. 

- For initial orientation, go to the [[Ideaverse Pro Arrival]] (You are here)
- For guidance on todos, find the [[Ideaverse Pro Checklist]].
- For your core experience, go to your **[[Ideaverse Pro Hangar]]**.
- When you feel lost, get reoriented with the [[Ideaverse Pro Index]].

You have access to multiple tutorials and trainings:

- ***LYT 101*** *Orientation*: Gain clarity on why you are here
- ***LYT 201*** *Ideation*: Learn how to think through linking
- ***LYT 301*** *Organization*: Organize every note you make

# Did you arrive successfully?

Make sure you did the following:

1. Open Ideaverse Pro as a separate vault. 
	- That means that you SHOULD NOT add it to your existing vault just yet.
2. Turn off "restricted mode" by choosing “Trust author and enable plugins” to enable the use of community plugins.

# Finish your onboarding

To finish your onboarding, make sure you can do the following things:

>  <div style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/1075911207?badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write; encrypted-media" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" title="Arriving into Ideaverse Pro"></iframe></div>

1. Open linked notes in new tabs.
	- Hit `Cmd-click` (or `ctrl-click` on Windows or Linux).
	- Try it now by clicking on [[Ideaverse Pro Hangar]], but come right back here after.
2. Use the LYT wayfinders to navigate.
	- Try it now by scrolling to the top of this note and clicking between "Arrival, Hangar,  Checklist, and Index."
