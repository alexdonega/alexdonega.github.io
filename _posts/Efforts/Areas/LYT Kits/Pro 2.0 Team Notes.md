	- [[Collections]]: Removed callouts. Deemphasized fancy to emphasize ease of use.
- Plugins Updates
	- Supercharged Links
	- Make sure everyone has the `lesson` property settings dialed in. Remember this plugin is controlled by "Style Settings" and also generates its own snippet. Very tricky to dial in between vaults.
  - Templater
    - Got the base [[templater]] `x/Templates/Base Templater Template.md` working,

	- Change `Insert Template` from `cmd-shift-s` to `cmd-e`
	- `Toggle reading view` no longer `cmd-e`
- Theme Updates
  - [x] Need to figure out how to fix the Rainbow folders. The "Efforts" blue here is too dark and not the teal shade it needs to be. _Asking team..._
	- The "Soft Paper" look while in the Minimal theme is controlled by Style Settings.
		- x Try to fix the super-faded non-selected pane icons (same as the Vault title, I believe). _Asking team..._
