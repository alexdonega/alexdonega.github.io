See [[IDV Pro packaging instructions]]

# Start with Ideaverse Pro

- Duplicate the IDV_Pro_Team vault into a new vault

> [!Wrench]+ How to "add all the stuff"
>
> - It's a delicate balancing act, because there are a lot of tiny tweaks as you work.
> - Have both vaults open side by side.
> - As a note is ready to be duplicated from `Ideaverse` to `Ideaverse Pro`, just have it "show in Finder" then opt-drag it directly onto `Ideaverse Pro` then move it to the proper areas.
> - You might end up making tweaks to the file in `Ideaverse Pro`. In that case, make sure to copy/paste anything back over to the master file in my personal `Ideaverse`.

- Use [[Home Pro Basic]] and [[Home Pro]] as your single source of truth.
- Update: the Obsidian version, all plugins, all themes.
- You don't have to include [[Ideaverse Pro Changelog]] in the vault, but the changelog needs to be updated, maintained, and shared in the proper public and community spaces online.
- [x] You'll probably want to update [[LYT Standards of Classification]] before adding it.
- Then, when it comes time for packaging, you'll need to copy and paste all of those notes into the following folder structure:

---

- **Home notes** » to the root level `/`
  - [x] [[Home Pro]] (don't need "Home" with Home Pro)
- **Map-adjacent**
  - [x] [[Collections]]

      - [x] Ensure Book Template works.
      - [x] Ensure Movie Template works.

- **Template Classification Master Keys**
  - [x] [[Master Key (People)]]
  - [x] [[Master Key (People)(ROAR)]]
- **Plugins**
  - [x] Add the Quick Add Plugin in `.obsidian/plugins` Settings
- **Scripts**
  - [x] `movie.js`: this hidden js file is used by a QuickAdd macro. If you want it to work immediately without change the QuickAdd settings, put this file in `x/x/Scripts`. It won't show up in Obsidian; you'll need to move it in Finder on Mac or File Explorer on Windows.
- **Images** » `x/Images`
  - Make sure you are not missing any images. If you are, just make it easy on yourself and move them in the main vault to `x/Images` so they will all be there in future packagings.

---

- Note: Only a few notes require me to spin off a `(Pro)` note, which I'd prefer to avoid when possible.

### Packaging Ideaverse Pro

- Zip it. Call the zip file `Ideaverse Pro - YYYY-MM-DD`.
- Place it in a parent folder with the date included as well.
- Upload to Google Drive to share with the team.

> [!cone]+ Make sure to update that very specific `.obsidian` subfolder!
> Then go back your main Ideaverse, and go to the subfolder: `Atlas/Vaults/Ideaverse/.obsidian`.  
>  - Copy the just-updated Ideaverse Pro `.obsidian` settings and paste them there. - This will save many future errors from happening.

# Then Do Ideaverse Zero

- First, duplicate the latest Ideaverse Pro by Option-dragging
- Rename it from Ideaverse Pro to Ideaverse Zero.
- Then open it.

  - What is an ideaverse
- Atlas
  - [x] Keep in `Atlas/Maps`...NOTE: _Make sure to keep any new Collections or types of maps that have auto-updating queries in them. That means you'll likely have to add to this list (and likely delete or rename a few too._

# Then, if you still have emojis in filenames

- Duplicate and get rid of them for the Windows version, but it's better just to get rid of them for the standard version.
- I should like to add them back to my personal ones.

# Then, here are tiny things to double-check

This was a list Nick added 2024-07-27 as 1.5 was being packaged.

- Let's toggle off Core Plugin `Sync`.
- Make sure no hotkeys are conflicting. Recently, these ones were:
  - Hotkey `Open link under cursor to the right`: delete the current hotkey
  - Hotkey `Open current tab in new window`: delete the current hotkey
  - Hotkey `QuickAdd: Run QuickAdd`: delete the current hotkey
  - Hotkey `Calendar: Open Weekly Note`: delete the current hotkey
- Left Ribbon: It's showing 11 icons. Hoping we can only show: Quick Switcher, Command Palette, Templates, and Graph (in that order)
- Linked Mentions Pane: Toggle on `Collapse results`
- Unlinked Mentions Pane: Fold unlinked mentions
- Bottom left pane position: Lower it from half down to 40% from the bottom (so it'll show fewer linked mentions).
- Upper right pane order left-to-right: File properties, Calendar, Tags, Outline, All properties
- Bookmarks pane: This is empty. Let's disable this Core Plugin.
- mapType: Completely delete all references to this property type
- mapPurpose: Completely delete all references to this property type
- Make `Home Pro Basic` the note IDV Pro opens on for the first time.
- Disable spellcheck
- Graph View Filters:
  - Add collections to be pink
  - Add Home notes to be yellow
  - Dots aqua
  - Maps purple
