# 2024-01-01 - Version 1.1

### Additional Features and Tweaks
- [ ] Official inclusion of the [[LYT Standards of Classification]] and the [[LYT Classification System for Personal Knowledge Management]]
- [ ] Changed properties `showSubgenre` to the new LYT universal standard `showGroup`
	- These "groups" are for where you can personally classify things. For example, I've classified the movie [[Predator]] with the `showGroup` called `Max Testosterone`. 
	- Typically, any `group` classification won't change; they are not for tracking the status of the thing. 
- [ ] Changed properties `poster` (for shows) and `cover` (for books) to the new LYT universal standard `image`
- [ ] Changed People Template by adding `peopleType` and `peopleGroups` and finally removed `tags` 
	- [ ] Added `People Template, Prominent Add-on` and `People Template, ROAR Add-on` to optionally expand properties for either prominent people or people I want to correspond with in some way.
- [ ] Changed the "Ideas" folder to mirror my personal ideaverse, which breaks them into "Things" and "Statements".
- [ ] Changed external links to orange to differentiate them from the internal purple links.
