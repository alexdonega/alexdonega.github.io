Wow. [**"I hate spoilers"**](https://ckarchive.com/b/0vuwh9ho0kn74)hit a nerve.

🔴 *I totally disagree about spoilers*

🟢 *Couldn't agree more*

🔴 *I have to respectfully disagree*

🟢 *This strangely aligned with me*

🟢 *I was debating seeing this movie today…you pushed me over the edge.*

I did not intend to spark this reaction. But there is something powerful here.

It is an extremely empowering concept.

I hope to share it soon. (Hint: the concept's initials are EE.)

# Upcoming awesomeness in May

There is so much happening in the world of linked notes this month. Here is what you can expect:

* **📽 Video Essays**: Obsidian "Continue Here" series: You voted, so I’m working on it. I am also so excited about "EE" that I feel compelled to share a video essay about it.
* **🧰 LYT Kit 6**: This will be the most massive update to the LYT Kit. I am so excited to share this because it is a completely new experience—and includes the ACCESS folder structure.
* 📡 **Linking Your Thinking Conference**: A week of amazing events.
* 🔆 **Linking Your Thinking Workshop 8**: Important dates released (below).

## 📡 Linking Your Thinking Conference (sneak peak)

What if there was a week to share practical examples of link-based thinking?

Now there is…

Introducing the first annual **Linking Your Thinking Conference**.

Keep your calendar open the week of Mon, May 16 - Fri, May 20.

It will be a week of live events.

You will get front row access to an impressive list of people using linked notes in clear and practical ways.

We’ve already lined up talks on research, Zettelkasten, journaling, personal retreats, how folder-based pardigms might complement link-based ones, and much more.

Guests and sign up details will be announced soon…

Things to remember:

*The mystique of rock climbing is climbing:*
*you get to the top of a rock glad its over*
*but really wish it would go on forever.*
*The justification of climbing is climbing,*
*like the justification of poetry is writing*

👣 **A LYT footnote** 🎵

The noise 🗑 is deafening. I promise to focus on the signal 🌿. For me, the signal is high-value, evergreen stuff like:

* how to think better and with more joy
* how to be a better ***note-maker*** instead of just a note-taker
* getting past the shiny surface and asking the deep questions
* spotlighting 🔦 people and ideas that have stood the test of time ✨

So until next time…

Stay connected,

Nick

PS: Did you know [I was interviewed on the Mac Power Users podcast](https://www.relay.fm/mpu/633)? I talked with David Sparks and Stephen Hackett about creating polished content, Obsidian, Apple, and of course personal knowledge management.

PPS: What is a "note habit" you would like to improve?
