There are a lot of pitfalls that can come from our attempts at managing our projects and tasks. For me over the years, not only would most of my attempts fail, but even when they were successful, it still meant I was spending too much time "thinking about managing tasks" instead of *doing* them.

That's why [Francisco Bricio's showcase video](https://youtu.be/Ehw3hUZNF1M) is so valuable to me: he shows how to focus on the signal to manage stuff both effectively *and* elegantly‚Äîin Obsidian.

This show case by Francisco focuses on how he manages knowledge when his focus is on projects, goals, and general productivity, but I want to make a point here. Francisco doesn't *just* focus on productivity.

Francisco is also a writer and a life long learner, because he‚Äîlike you ‚Äîis a complex and multi-faceted human. So while this illuminating showcase is about Francisco‚Äôs patterns of thought during productivity-driven PKM, there are other times when Francisco switches contexts to focus on, say, writing a book, and that has its own distinct weather pattern on the PKM Planet.

(Here's a rough, simple sketch of this weather pattern on the planet.)
