| I love physical books. I love flipping through them. I love knowing exactly where I am in them. They are a landscape, a map. The spatial orientation they provide improves our ability to build better understanding. I don‚Äôt believe the weak studies that say audiobooks and e-readers are the same as reading physical books. Same how? In the consumption of words? Sure. But not in the comprehension of ideas. Okay? I love physical books. Are we clear? That said, I love audiobooks. I love them even more than I thought. And the reason is not what you think. ***I sit too much.*** I‚Äôm so tired of sitting. If you have work that requires you to sit (or stand) for hours at a desk‚Äîand that‚Äôs a lot of us‚Äîthen you can take advantage of the audiobook. Since I‚Äôve been sitting for major parts of the day, the last thing I want to do is sit to read a book. So guess what happens? I don‚Äôt read. Yes, I‚Äôm very comfortable having a robust anti-library of unread books reminding me of themselves with their sultry spines, but I do actually want to take them out to dance for a bit. With audiobooks, I can. I move around while I listen. I do the dishes. I go outside and walk for long distances while listening. After sitting for many hours, it feels so much better to listen to a third of Michael Gerber‚Äôs E-Myth and half of Paulo Cuelho‚Äôs The Alchemist on a long walk. (I did this on Sunday along Venice Beach.) I would never have done that if I were sitting. ***I recently did the math‚Ä¶*** Over the past several years, I have been reading ten times as much by audiobook as compared to physical books (or e-readers). That‚Äôs a massive difference. That said, I suspect my ability to retain information from audiobooks drops to 70%, as compared to physical books. But that's okay, and here's why: *Because I‚Äôm effortlessly reading 10x as much,* ***I‚Äôm actually learning and retaining 7x more than I normally would.*** This is huge! Plus, I have ways to improve the retention of audiobooks. Here's what works for me‚Ä¶ 5 Ways to get the most out of audiobooksLow energy ways to improve audiobook retention **Take fast notes**: If something sparks for you while listening, hit pause. Open Obsidian. Make a note for the book if you haven‚Äôt already. Then just type out the gist of it. Now the book note is handy, so when you need to return to it, you‚Äôll be able to quickly. If it‚Äôs really resonating, bookmark it in your audio app to revisit later. **Make instant dictations**: After reading a section (or whenever you feel inspired), hit pause. Open a voice memo app. Hit record. Start articulating what you heard, what it reminds you of, and why it matters to you. This is the highest leverage tactic to improve your recall: by immediately talking about it. * You‚Äôll often be amazed at how little you can articulate. This is good. It‚Äôs a reality check that there are levels to ‚Äúknowing‚Äù, and just because you ‚Äúknow‚Äù something, doesn‚Äôt mean you *know* something; but in this process, you have a mechanism that improves your understanding of the very thing. We‚Äôre applying the timeless principle ‚ÄúTeach to Learn‚Äù to audiobooks. Medium energy ways to improve audiobook retention **Return to the physical book**: If you are lucky enough to also have a physical copy of the book, return to it later and find the parts that sparked. Do any of the following: Flag the pages, make marks in the margin, make remarks in the margin. When you combine audiobook with physical book like this, it will feel strangely profound. As needed, add more notes and ideas to your note in Obsidian. **Map your understanding**: My favorite part. I open my Obsidian book note. I review all of the notes and ideas and quotes I've added‚Ä¶and I start clustering ideas, which then sparks new insights, which leads to a more enriching and meaningful understanding of the book and its ideas. High energy ways to improve audiobook retention **Revisit your bookmarks**: Don‚Äôt feel like you have to do this before playing around in your map of content. Don't feel like you have to do this completely either! Returning to a non-descriptive list of bookmarks is probably the least fun aspect of the audiobook process. * If you use Audible, it‚Äôll save the 30 seconds *before* you hit the bookmark button, so keep that in mind. Basically, you‚Äôll want to remember why you made the bookmark, then with a tool like Obsidian open, type out your version of it (or a quote if it‚Äôs really well written). Where people get the book argument wrong Most people arguing about physical books vs audiobooks are stuck on the wrong points. They are overlooking our modern day lifestyles. If reading a physical book is physically uncomfortable because you've already been sitting all day, then reading becomes hard. However, listening becomes easy. The real question to ask, the question that really matters, is this: ***Does one format allow you to read or listen WAY more?*** *If so, do more of that one.* ‚Äã Obsidian Plugin of the Week **Surfing**: The surfing plugin by Boninall allows you to browse the web within Obsidian. If your Obsidian is open, [click this link to go directly to it.](obsidian://show-plugin?id=surfing)‚Äã While I don't want to replace my internet browser, sometimes it's not fun to toggle between Obsidian and a website. I first heard about this from Greg K. who took the WOW Workshop. He would open a link to the WOW Curriculum on the right, while taking notes on the left. Then Greg K. went further and showed us that the Surfing plugin also allows for you to get a sneak peak into your external links by hovering over them and holding cmd (ctrl on windows). This gives us the same functionality for external links as the core plugin "Page Preview" gives us for internal links. Let me know if you like Surfing, and let me know if you like the Plugin of the Week format. If so, I'll try to feature one in some newsletters moving forward. ‚Äã[What's a less-popular Obsidian plugin that you really like?

Last week, I asked you to vote about what we are calling *"this thing that we do in tools like Obsidian, Roam, Tana‚Ä¶where we link notes to other notes?"* I gave you four options. I provided a series of questions. We had around 200 responses. The results were inconclusive, but I have some takeaways below. * While "Linked Thinking" had the most votes, no term really won. * "Connected" likely would have had more if "Connective" didn't siphon off votes. * There were a lot of "Other" votes. * This newsletter skews towards thoughtful, curious people, and that showed up on your responses to the final "anything else?" question. * And then there is "Networked". It performed poorly. The worst actually. But in the comments, it had strong arguments for it. * One suggestion from you that I would add in future votes would be "Relational Thinking". Well, it turns out, I can do polls right here, and you can see the results come in (they say). So let's test it out: But a surprising takeaway of mine is questioning if trying to affix an adjective in front of "thinking" is the best approach. What about "knowledge", as in Networked Knowledge, or Linked Knowledge, or Relational Knowledge. Hmm, I don't know‚Ä¶so let's test it! These newsletter polls are limited, so if you have more to say, just [email me](mailto:hello@linkingyourthinking.com). ‚Äã Quick Hits * I answered virtually zero emails all of May because of the WOW Workshop. * After I send this to you, I'm going on a personal retreat in the mountains. * The WOW Workshop was a massive hit. So proud of it. * My video game-playing phase is over. It's addictive, so I eliminated the distraction. The pull has slowly faded over the past two weeks, though it's not completely gone. * We are working on an amazing ideaverse/digital garden/blog and I hope to reveal more on that soon. * Here's a running list of topics I want to write about: Ultraspeaking | Weekend Retreat | GrowBIG Training | Peerdraft --- ‚Äã Stay connected, Nick ‚Äã P.S‚Ä¶What's on your mind these days?

I promise to focus on the signal üåø. For me, the signal is high-value, evergreen stuff like: ‚Ä¢ how to think better and with more joy ‚Ä¢ how to be a better ***notemaker*** instead of just a notetaker ‚Ä¢ getting past the shiny surface and asking the deep questions ‚Ä¢ spotlighting üî¶ people and ideas that have stood the test of time ‚ú® |
