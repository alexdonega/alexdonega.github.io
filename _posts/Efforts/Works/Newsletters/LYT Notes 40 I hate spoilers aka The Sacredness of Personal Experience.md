*Have you seen it Nick?*

It was 1999 and my older brother just asked me if I had seen the movie everyone was raving about: **The Sixth Sense**.

I wanted to sound cool so I said yes.

Then he asked the question everyone was asking after seeing it…

«« SPOILER ALERT for a movie that's 23 years old »»

*"When did you know that Bruce Willis was actually dead?"*

I felt instant regret.

I was devastated. "Robbed of a juicy riddle" (as I have written about before).

Ever since that day, I have hated spoilers.

Especially the people who think they aren't spoiling it by talking about it.

I want to say to them, "Everything you are saying is putting your stink all over my experience of it!"

But deep down, that's what they want—even if they don't know it.

That's right. They want to "own it" in the minds of the people they are talking to.

It's not cool.

If you are trying to "own it" in the minds of others, you taint the experience for others.

If you LOVE a movie, just say, "you have to watch" this movie.

I LOVE "Everything Everywhere All at Once".

I love it so much that I'm not going to talk about it.

I love it so much, I'm not going to ruin it by trying to "process" it.

I love it so much, I'm not going to try to "own it" by writing about it.

The same goes for the last movie that made me feel this strongly: Parasite.

Some things are better left un-analyzed.

Because in the analyzing, you murder the magic for yourself.

There are some things that just feel wrong.

Trying to reduce a work of art to its "first principles" is misguided.

Trying to "own" a work of art in the minds of others by talking loudly about it is disrespectful—to others and to the work itself.

Don't get me wrong, beautiful art often gets spread by "word of mouth". We are social beings, we have to share what we are excited about.

Just ask yourself:

*Am I sharing because I want others to experience the emotions I felt?*

or

*Am I sharing because I want to capitalize on the moment?*

How to honor a work of art that has really touched you**:**

1. Tell people they should experience it.
2. Honor their experience by not saying more about it.

This allows you to share what you are excited about while still honoring the sacredness of their personal experience.

## LYT Kit 6

Link-based thinking continues to explode in popularity.

From 2020, I have been sharing something called the LYT Kit. It is the #1 starter kit for people interested in link-based thinking.

I never intended for such a wide audience to be downloading it. I originally made it for the earliest uber-nerds. So as cool as it is, the LYT Kit can *and should* give people a smoother intro to linking.

No matter if you are just starting out or having been linking your thinking for a few years, the new LYT Kit 6 is being redesigned to give you more clarity, more guidance, and more practical examples.

Coming soon…

👣 **A LYT footnote** 🎵

The noise 🗑 is deafening. I promise to focus on the signal 🌿. For me, the signal is high-value, evergreen stuff like:

* how to think better and with more joy
* how to be a better ***note-maker*** instead of just a note-taker
* getting past the shiny surface and asking the deep questions
* spotlighting 🔦 people and ideas that have stood the test of time ✨

So until next time…

Stay connected,

Nick

PS: At least one big announcement coming next week..
