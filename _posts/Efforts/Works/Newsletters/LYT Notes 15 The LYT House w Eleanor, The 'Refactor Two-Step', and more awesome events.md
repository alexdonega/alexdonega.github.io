## Do the "Refactor Two Step"

Old married couples can typically dance a nice two-step. And they always seem to have a beautiful story about how they met (if you ever asked).

They didn't always dance that smoothly. And their story wasn't always that touching.

Over the decades, they have had a lot of opportunities to dance, and to share their story. It gets tiring to always tell the same story. Especially when that story is "we met at a bar." So what happens is that they tell their story in a slightly different ways each time, picking up on the parts that made the best impact on their audience. Eventually, they get to something like this:

**BRIDE**: The night we met, I wasn't going to go out. I had just finished babysitting, my hair was a mess, and I had throwup on my shirt. But my sister begged me to meet up with her friends. Apparently they found this tall, single, hunky guy.
**GROOM**: (blushes)
**BRIDE**: So I summon up all my strength to get motivated to go out. I do my hair, I put on a nice outfit, and I meet up with everyone, and there he is looking all handsome and hunky.
**GROOM**: (blushes again)
**BRIDE**: And you know what?? He doesn't say ONE WORD to me the whole night. NOTHING. He barely looks in my direction.
**AUDIENCE**: (Gasps and open mouths)
**BRIDE**: But then, the next day, apparently he asked my sister for my number. We go out on a date and hit it off immediately!
**AUDIENCE**: (to the Groom) Why didn't you talk to her the first night?
**GROOM**: Well‚Ä¶I had already drank too much that night, and when I saw her, I was in love, but I knew if I opened my mouth, I would have said something stupid and completely blown it.
**AUDIENCE** (ahhhhhh ‚ù§Ô∏è)

That wasn't the first version of their story. They naturally ***refactored*** it.

So why not do that with our ideas and insights?

During the LYT House session with Eleanor, I hope to quickly show her (and you) the "Refactor Two-Step", which is how I refactor notes from a daily note, so they can more easily get refactored again in the future into a beautiful story.

Refactored Knowledge is the way.

## This is a big month

Yesterday, the LYT Workshop finished for Cohort 3b. I always say this, because it always happens‚Ä¶People love the material but are blown away at the insights and relationships they make with the rest of the community.

The next four weeks are packed with value‚Ä¶Along with all the LYT House sessions, I want to invite you to some premium live events I'll be leading. Two of them are open to everyone!

(All times Pacific (UTC-7))

* Aug 1, Sunday at 10 AM - **The LYT Kit, Version 5** - At this live event, the kit will be officially released for download, I'll provide a proper overview of the LYT Kit, and we will have a Q&A session all about it. (This will be the only chance to enroll early in Cohort 4.)
* Aug 7, Saturday at 10 AM *(for Pre-enrollees only)* - **Focus & Prepare** - Nick and many of the brilliant minds in the LYT community will help prepare you for the workshop. For those people using Obsidian, we'll also go over the four recommended plugins to use.
* Aug 8, Sunday at 10 AM - **Sensemaking 101** - A live hands-on session focused on getting you working your thinking muscles. I love these sessions. They are one of the highlights of the workshop, and I'm excited to do one with everyone!

## When is the next workshop?

It starts Aug 31. More info later.

üë£ **A LYT footnote** üéµ

The noise üóë is deafening. I promise to focus on the signal üåø. For me, the signal is high-value, evergreen stuff like:

* how to think better and with more joy
* how to be a better ***note-maker*** instead of just a note-taker
* getting past the shiny surface and asking the deep questions
* spotlighting üî¶ people and ideas that have stood the test of time ‚ú®

So until next time‚Ä¶ [[Stay Connected]],

Nick
