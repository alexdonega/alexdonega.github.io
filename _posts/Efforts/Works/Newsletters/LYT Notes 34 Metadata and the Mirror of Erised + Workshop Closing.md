Metadata gives you information about the note you are looking at.

It does two major things:

1. Metadata can provide fast insights about the note
2. Metadata can be leveraged powerfully with queries

Metadata has a lot of potential. And that's why you must exercise caution.

Because the lure of metadata is powerful.

Just like the Mirror of Erised, you can get lost in it.

What is the Mirror of Erised? It is a magical mirror in the world of Harry Potter.

“*Men have wasted away before it, not knowing if what they have seen is real, or even possible.*”
— Albus Dumbledore explaining the Mirror of Erised to Harry Potter

The mirror shows what you most **desire**. (Flip "Erised" around 😉 )

When it comes to PKM—especially when our minds feel chaotic—we desire order.

So we stare into our PKM's "Mirror of Erised" and spend countless hours trapped in a loop—tidying up our metadata—hoping it will solve the chaos we feel inside.

But it is a pursuit of the impossible: **perfect structure**.

Perfect structure can never be achieved, and many have wasted away their best thinking while being consumed in this desire.

The types of metadata you can add to the top (or bottom) of a note can be overwhelming. The trap is giving yourself unnecessary busywork every time to create a new note. For the sake of your best thinking, you must avoid this.

**So instead of desiring perfect structure, let's focus on practical structure.**

Try to limit the amount metadata labels you use.

* Fewer metadata labels = easier to upkeep
* Fewer metadata labels = less cognitive load

To summarize, here is the core rule of thumb:

**Prioritize “relevance” over structure. Only add structure when needed.**

We cover metadata near the end of the 6-week LYT Workshop. But I want to share a brief section of the workshop with you:

*For most notes, I put a link at the top. It’s not an “uplink”. And it’s not just any link. It’s the most relevant link. It’s really a “top link”.*
*I think of this as the “LYT Link” because by adding this link, you are completing the goal of “Linking Your Thinking” by actually linking your thinking.*
*Like “Highlander”, there can only be one LYT Link per note. This constraint is awesome, because it forces you to think about what you link, which literally strengthens the neural connection in your brain between the two ideas you are linking. 🤯*

Hopefully this can nudge you to avoid the worst of the pitfalls with pursuing "perfect structure".

## Enrollment in LYT Workshop 7 closes tomorrow

We are happy to report that we have notified all scholarship awardees for Workshop 7.

The Scholarship Review Team is made up of LYT Alumni, many of whom were on scholarship themselves. Competition is high and not everyone makes it. Some applicants who didn't made it the first time have re-applied and made it on subsequent attempts, so if you applied but didn't make it this time, please know that you can always re-apply for the next one.

### *Tomorrow is the last day to enroll!*

If you still are on the edge, check out this [livestream public launch party](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIOpPPLQRqw) we just did where several LYT Alumni talk about their workshop experience.

I never Livestreamed before but somehow it went smoothly. It's really thanks to **Dan Lardi** who MC'ed the event.

Also, big shoutout to all the amazing participants both on screen and in the live chat—especially since we went over on time: **Bianca, Francisco, Sana, Yolanda, Ellyn, Rok, Bragatte, Valerie, John, Anya, Deirdre, Phil, Gary. Keaton, Shirley, Ricardo,** and **Jack.** (I'm sure I missed several of you and my apologies in advance.)

## Recording with Zsolt on Visual Thinking

*Thanks for joining my newsletter.*

*It allows me to share early releases of special recordings like this one.*

*It won't be available publicly for another month or two.*

Recently, I had a chat and screenshare with **Zsolt Viczián** about visual thinking and his work with Excalidraw.

You can [watch the recording here in a private link](https://www.linkingyourthinking.com/lyt-house-season-2/zsolt-viczian).

👣 **A LYT footnote** 🎵

The noise 🗑 is deafening. I promise to focus on the signal 🌿. For me, the signal is high-value, evergreen stuff like:

* how to think better and with more joy
* how to be a better ***note-maker*** instead of just a note-taker
* getting past the shiny surface and asking the deep questions
* spotlighting 🔦 people and ideas that have stood the test of time ✨

So until next time…

[[Stay Connected]],

Nick

PS: While scholarship applications for the LYT Workshop are closed, we are opening ***three (3) more spots for PhD students***. [If you are currently going for your PhD, you can **apply here for a merit-based scholarship** in the next two days](https://apply.linkingyourthinking.com/scholarship-workshop-7).
