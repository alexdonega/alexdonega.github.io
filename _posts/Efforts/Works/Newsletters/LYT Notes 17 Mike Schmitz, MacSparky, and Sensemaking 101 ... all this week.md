## LYT House with David Sparks (MacSparky) - *Thursday*

**David Sparks**—of MacSparky, the Focused podcast, the Mac Power Users podcast, the amazing MacSparky Field Guides—and self-proclaimed but accurate "Internet Rascal" climbs the LYT House to chat with Nick about how he is using Obsidian and maybe even to screenshare a thing or two. After that, there will be an AMA session with David.

​Some topics…

* ​What is "toxic productivity"?
* ​Would David call himself lifelong geek?
* ​What was your first computer?
* ​What makes "Mac Power Users" so special?
* ​What are you using Obsidian for?
* ​What aren't you using Obsidian for?
* ​What are "personal retreats" and how do you do them?

## Sensemaking 101, Interactive Session - *Sunday*

Every LYT Workshop has 4 hands-on sensemaking sessions.

I love these things!

They are high-value training sessions where we work the note-making muscles. From a list of things, we rapidly make meaning and generate ideas and insights.

## LYT Workshop 4 - Enrollment opening - *Sunday*

Last time, enrollment was cut off 7 hours after it opened. (We are allowing more participants this time, but I can't promise we won't fill up again.)

If you [opt-in here](https://publish.obsidian.md/lyt-kit/Email+Thanks), you will receive the Workshop 4 enrollment email a day early.

PS: If you pre-enrolled for the LYT Workshop 4, I'll email you separately about our other event. 🤫

PPS: If are you a LYT Alumni and want to take the workshop again, re-enrollment opens later. I'll message you all separately. ⏲

PPPS: Can any LYT Alumni help during the LYT House with Mike Schmitz today? Shoutout to **Deirdre** for spontaneously helping me and Daniel during the LYT Kit session on Sunday 👏

PPPPS: To everyone else asking about the LYT Kit event, we had 333 people attend the live event. I want to always give everyone tons of value, so you can [**watch the LYT Kit recording** and **download LYT Kit v5 here**](https://www.linkingyourthinking.com/lyt-kit-v5-overview).
