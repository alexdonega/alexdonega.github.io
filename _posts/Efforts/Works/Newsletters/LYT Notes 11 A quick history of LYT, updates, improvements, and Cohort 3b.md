This email is for the 6500+ people who have signed up for this newsletter in the past 8 months.

I wanted to update you on how the Linking Your Thinking community has grown, what has changed, and what that means for you.

## A quick history of LYT cohorts

In the summer of 2020, I asked a few people I saw on the Obsidian forums if they would like to be a part of a workshop covering link-based thinking. That became **Cohort 1**. The curriculum was on Teachable and our chat was a single direct message group on Discord.

Going into the fall of 2020, a lot improved. I expanded and refined the curriculum. I left Teachable in exchange for Discourse (I don‚Äôt think my priorities align with the Teachable/Circle folks‚Äô.) In Discourse, I mimicked the linking structure of LYT for each unit. We ended up with ‚âà55 people in **Cohort 2** and I think it‚Äôs fair to say the experience was a rousing success.

Going into January 2021, the curriculum received minor tweaks. We added PDF guides for each unit to help the participant focus on the key things. We had ‚âà115 people for **Cohort 3**. While it too was a rousing success, I wanted to make sure everyone still felt a high-touch experience.

FYI: The ‚ÄúDunbar Number‚Äù for being a high-touch online workshop leader is 55.

Instead of rushing into Cohort 4, I wanted to build a foundation that could reliably scale for an even greater amount of participants. So we decided to do two mini cohorts before Cohort 4 in August (which is poised to be quite, quite large).

## Cohort 3a

In Cohort 3a, perhaps the biggest change in Cohort 3a was adding crews of ‚âà8 people and Crew Leaders (*Francisco, Sana, Hojae, Charles P, Jason, Jack, William, Mat, and Alicia*).

They added tremendous value in live sessions, whether it was the breakout rooms, the leader-led sessions, and the informal crew sessions.

## Updates and improvements for Cohort 3b

**Members Workbook**: The goal is to give members something to support their efforts. The workbook will outline key learning objectives and spotlight learning milestones, so they can feel like they are making progress each week.

**LYT Sorting Hat Survey**: I‚Äôm very excited for this. Cohorts 1 and 2 took the first versions of this questionnaire. Then in Cohort 3, we made it an interactive questionnaire during a live session. Now, it‚Äôs being remade into robust and fairly ambitious survey. Member‚Äôs results are only the start of a throughline that ties into the 4 core leagues (Researchers, Sensemakers, Writers, and Productivity), which ties into live sessions, and ultimately into the unique goals and use cases of each person.

All of these will have a version ready in time for‚Ä¶

## Cohort 3b

Cohort 3b will remain a mini-cohort, but it‚Äôs going to be bigger than 3a. Instead of 40 members, we will cap enrollment at 50 members.

New things in Cohort 3b:

* ***LYT Sorting Hat Survey***: As mentioned, this ‚Äúpersonality test‚Äù will be helpful for members to understand their PKM efforts more clearly, and to help people trying to accomplish similar things to find each other and converse more easily.
* ***4 Extra Live League Sessions***: One for each league: Researchers, Sensemakers, Writers, and Productivity. These will be a mixture of a symposium (different presentations) and some will even have a hands-on working session (evergreen note-making exercises).
* ***Leader-led Sessions***: Leaders for 3b will:
  + Be part of the presenter list during one of the League Sessions.
  + Lead an extra live session (or more).

Because of all of this, 3b is closer to being a full blown cohort, just with a 50 person limit.

> Interested in hearing more about Cohort 3b, starting on June 1?

If you [opt-in here](https://publish.obsidian.md/lyt-kit/Email+Thanks), you will receive the Cohort 3b enrollment email on May 17. Last time, enrollment was cut off 10 hours after it opened!

## You and LYT

**Your LYT Community Access**: If you pay for any cohort (essential, guided, or self-study), you‚Äôll always have curriculum access and community access. You‚Äôll even have random access to *some* live events!

You just won‚Äôt have access to future cohorts, unless you pay a re-attendance fee of $122. (Screamin' deal btw‚Ä¶)

**LYT Community Patron**: I know everyone loves the idea of passive income through monthly memberships. I don‚Äôt. It creates a ‚Äúwhat have you done for me lately‚Äù incentive in the mind of the subscriber. So instead, I‚Äôm *this close* to offering only one type of optional membership, the ‚ÄúLYT Community Patron‚Äù, for $222/yr.

* Patrons support the Linking Your Thinking community and ethos of kind-spirited note-making (and are recognized for it in various ways TBD)
* Patrons sponsor a scholarship student for a cohort (maybe even able to choose from the list of applicants‚Ä¶One of my favorite parts of this is reading the scholarship applications and reaching out to grant some.)
* Patrons do not pay for Cohort Re-attendance. They just have to join before it kicks off to prevent administrative nightmares, so there are no ‚Äúmid-streamers‚Äù.

What do you think of this approach to memberships?

This journey has been full of discovery and gratitude. I‚Äôm exciting to keep developing it.

Best,

Nick
