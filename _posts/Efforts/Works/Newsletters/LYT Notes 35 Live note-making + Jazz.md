One night last week, I listened to jazz. The next morning I decided to record my efforts to learn, understand, and honor the topic in my PKM system.

It is hard to capture the thinking process. This is my unfiltered attempt. I like jazz. I have thought about jazz. But I have barely written about it until now.

I call this type of note-making "map-making". I use a core note called an MOC (Map of Content). I link out from it as needed. It allows me to think from both the "top-down" and "bottom-up" at the same time.

"Map-making" is one way to supercharge our note-making efforts.

This was a lot of fun for me to do.

If you are forcing yourself to make notes, then something is out of alignment.

"Fun" is a feeling to play attention to ;)

## Second Brain Summit

Tiago Forte—of "Building a Second Brain"—joined LYT Workshop 7, which still has a few weeks to go. That surprised some of you because parts of my PKM philosophy don't always fit nicely with his. But from my perspective, when Tiago joined the LYT Workshop it really showcased his commitment to being a life-long learner.

We've since had fun talking through many PKM topics and he even invited me to be a speaker at the upcoming "Second Brain Summit". (The summit has an [impressive lineup of speakers](https://www.secondbrainsummit.com/).)

I really appreciate and resonate Tiago's desire to elevate PKM—Personal Knowledge Management—into a field with diverse and sometimes competing perspectives. It's a testament to our shared understanding that PKM is *personal.*

My presentation is called ***“The Joy of Thinking and the Rise of the Note Maker”***.

## Audiocast on Twitter

Bianca Pereira—our new Head of Community Experience—has started live audio calls on Twitter Spaces. She invited me to talk about:

* ​[“PKM for Research: PKM Mindsets”](https://twitter.com/bianca_oli_per/status/1495502107247624192)​
  + 💭 notes as containers of thoughts
  + ⚛ atomic and 🌲evergreen notes
  + 🧩 pieces of truth vs 🧠 pieces of understanding”

The recording on Twitter will disappear in a couple weeks I think.

## Quick Hit

* The Russian war on Ukraine has affected us all in some way. It’s not much, but I’ve refunded 100% of all Ukrainian’s payments to “Linking Your Thinking”—both for the workshops and for flight school. I found [this piano concerto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEGOihjqO9w) by Sergei Rachmaninoff (born in Russia)—played by Anna Fedorova (born in Kviv, Ukraine)—particularly resonant.
* The LYT Workshop 7 has gone through a major refactoring: sharper, tighter, and even more value (if that was even possible). I’ve rewritten and rerecorded big chunks of it. Can’t wait to drop the latest changes on the unsuspecting LYT Alumni next month.
* On that note, the workshop takes a lot out of me. Or put another way, I put a lot into the workshop…the people, the curriculum, the experience, the comments, the discussions, the live sessions…that’s why I haven’t emailed you lately. I know many of you have reached out in some capacity, if you haven’t heard back from me, that’s probably why.

👣 **A LYT footnote** 🎵

The noise 🗑 is deafening. I promise to focus on the signal 🌿. For me, the signal is high-value, evergreen stuff like:

* how to think better and with more joy
* how to be a better ***note-maker*** instead of just a note-taker
* getting past the shiny surface and asking the deep questions
* spotlighting 🔦 people and ideas that have stood the test of time ✨

So until next time…

PS: I have a long-overdue sequel to the Youtube video ["What is PKM"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2WBHyqRsxA). It’s been written for months. I just have to record and edit it. Hopefully soon. And most important, I hope you are safe and well.
