Working with your notes should not feel like a police interrogation.
It should feel fun. Your PKM can be your friend.

I am noticing a lot of people are wondering, "Am I doing PKM right?"

That's not a bad question, but we have to tweak the focus.

Focus less on what you "have to" do.

Focus more on what fuels you‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶on what feeds you.

That's why **Nadja Bester**'s showcase is so timely.

It is a reminder to feed your subconscious before you burnout (again).

# Death by 1,000 clips

*"After several years, opening Evernote was no longer fun. It was stressful. Just thinking about it filled me with dread."*

From 2008 to 2015, I used Evernote.

My notes were great‚Ä¶at first.

But the initial sweetness lured me into a trap. After a while‚Ä¶

* My notes felt buried and lost.
* I couldn‚Äôt find what I wanted to find.
* I felt like I had experienced ‚Äúdigital dementia.‚Äù
* I hated that my thoughts felt locked away in someone else‚Äôs software.

I escaped in 2015. I discovered a better way. A way that is both fun and future-proof. Yes yes yes, it is based on linking notes together. (i.e. "linking your thinking")

But it doesn‚Äôt stop there.

It is based on emergent structures that organically support your notes over time.

Because here‚Äôs the thing: ***one-size-fits-all systems set you up to fail.***

Those systems are someone else‚Äôs system. Not yours.

Each of us needs our own flexible system. We need ‚Äúfluid frameworks‚Äù that we can customize to *our own* unique needs.

The LYT Workshop trains you in these frameworks. It forces you to work with‚Äîand develop‚Äîthem for your own needs.

The LYT Frameworks are based on ‚ÄúSystems Theory‚Äù and can be used by *anyone*. They ensure your knowledge is kept flexible and future-proof.

If this is intriguing to you and you want to learn more, you are invited to this FREE live super event called ***"The 2022 Launch Party for the LYT Workshop!"***

*‚Äã*

*If a garden is too close to the street, people won't use it because it isn't private enough. But if it too far from the street, then it won't be used either, because it is too isolated. -* A Pattern Language, p.545

How does this apply to my PKM?

üë£ **A LYT footnote** üéµ

The noise üóë is deafening. I promise to focus on the signal üåø. For me, the signal is high-value, evergreen stuff like:

* how to think better and with more joy
* how to be a better ***note-maker*** instead of just a note-taker
* getting past the shiny surface and asking the deep questions
* spotlighting üî¶ people and ideas that have stood the test of time ‚ú®

So until next time‚Ä¶
