You're receiving this letter because you recognize that note-taking is not enough. You recognize the growing value of note-making.

Eleanor's back! Our walkthrough about *"How to turn your notes into published articles and books"* was a big hit apparently. If you were one of the people who were like, "less Nick, more Eleanor!", then your wishes have been granted :)

I'm an amateur when it comes to reference managers like Zotero, but I still like to read research papers sometimes and incorporate that knowledge into the notes I make. So if you're like me, then [Eleanor's Zotero + Obsidian walkthrough](https://youtu.be/XbGJH08ZfCs) will be very helpful. You should check it out!

## It's not the tool. It's your relationship to knowledge.

If you're new to this movement of link-based thinking, or you just saw my video on "Why Obsidian Overtakes Roam" (from last year), you may think I really like talking about the differences between these powerful apps. I really don't. What I try to be hyper-aware of though, is how our tools shape us. Because our tools are just another part of the environment that surrounds us‚Äîmolding us in ways we will never fully comprehend.

So when it comes to tools, sure, spend some time coming to your own conclusions, but then get back to what matters. Here are the things I care about much more than conversations around the features that tools have:

* What is your relationship to knowledge? How healthy is it? How sustainable is it? How joyful?
* How much time do you spend consuming and collecting versus actually putting the ideas you encounter through the rounds, against the grindstone?

What I see that gets me fired up, is when people with platforms‚Äîpeople with positions of responsibility‚Äîare making money encouraging others to over-collect, over-highlight, and yet under-think. Why do I care?? Because they are teaching people to develop the habits that will form a toxic relationship to ***knowledge*** in the long-term.

And when that toxic relationship‚Äîbased on FOMO, "Shiny Object Syndrome", and superficial thinking‚Äîbackfires 3-5 years down the road, people will either become disillusioned with PKM or they will think *they* are the problem, losing some self-worth and feeling shame.

They are not the problem. The problem is the cumulative result of developing and habitualizing a toxic relationship to knowledge over the years.

We're all trying to figure out how to handle the Information Age and having access to limitless stuff. I hope this creates enough discomfort to force the bigger questions to be asked a bit more often:

* ***What is my relationship to knowledge?***
* ***Am I spending too much time consuming and collecting, and therefore not enough time thinking in more active, nourishing ways?***

PS: Something I can't get out of my head that I heard‚Ä¶ "It's *because* of Sauron, that the Shire exists."

PPS: Tolkien wrote the languages before he wrote the books. Wonder what that says about Tolkien's relationship to knowledge‚Ä¶
