*"Tina loves Joey."*

*"For a good time call this number."*

What's up with public restrooms having all those scribbles on the walls?

I mean, who does that?

Well, one time I did.

But first, some back story‚Ä¶I was 18 and back from my first semester in college. It was the holiday season. Christmas Eve actually. And my dad said we could open presents a day early if we solved his riddle. So he gave us one of the best and hardest riddles of all time. A riddle for the ages. (I will share this elsewhere.)

I chewed on the riddle trying to solve it.

I wrestled with it.

It was frustrating, and yet surprisingly, kinda fun.

Then my brother emerged from the computer room and he blurted out the answer (this predates everyone having cell phones).

He technically "answered" the riddle, so we were able to open presents.

You'd think I would have been happy to open presents but I wasn't.

***I was disappointed because I was robbed of a wonderful riddle.***

I wanted the riddle to live on, so two weeks later I was back in the college dorms, writing the whole thing out on the wall of a bathroom stall. (And pleading with them not to go online to find the answer.)

Everyone soon found out about the riddle and word reached them that I wrote it.

Then something amazing happened‚Ä¶

I'll share the end of this story today in a live presentation called:

***‚ÄúThe Joy of Thinking and the Rise of the Note Maker‚Äù***.

This presentation is part of the "Second Brain Summit", hosted by Tiago Forte, the creator of Building a Second Brain. We are at the very beginning of the PKM movement and the frontiers stretch out before us. That's why it's an honor to be a presenter at this wonderful summit.

It's also a responsibility that I take to heart, and I will do my best to honor that responsibility. You have a responsibility too‚Äîif you attend.

I'm going to say things that make you uncomfortable. Lean into it.

Be comfortable with being uncomfortable.

Disagree with me.

Make counter-points.

The greatest offense is your silence.

Especially because I'm going to challenge many of the ideas you may have been hearing.

Oh, and we are going to do a note-making exercise where YOU have to do the thinking.

***By the end of the presentation, we will have covered multiple epiphanies, grievances, and paradigm shifts‚Äîalong with 2 questions and 1 riddle.***

üë£ **A LYT footnote** üéµ

The noise üóë is deafening. I promise to focus on the signal üåø. For me, the signal is high-value, evergreen stuff like:

* how to think better and with more joy
* how to be a better ***note-maker*** instead of just a note-taker
* getting past the shiny surface and asking the deep questions
* spotlighting üî¶ people and ideas that have stood the test of time ‚ú®

So until next time‚Ä¶

[[Stay Connected]],

PS: For those familiar with entrepreneurial startup companies, I finally realized what the LYT Workshop really is. It's the Y Combinator of PKM. Y Combinator is a startup accelerator. The LYT Workshop is a PKM accelerator.

PPS: We've made massive headway in treating PKM as more than a way to track tasks. PKM is SO much more. I can't wait to continue sharing new ways to find enrichment, calm, and joy in the ongoing act of linking our thinking. The Youtube videos are going to explode soon with helpful tidbits‚Ä¶
