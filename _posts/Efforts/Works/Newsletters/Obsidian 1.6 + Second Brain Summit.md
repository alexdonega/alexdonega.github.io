| Obsidian 1.6.0 (early access) is now available to **Catalyst members** on desktop. **​**[**Learn more about Catalyst here** (not sponsored) **»**](https://obsidian.md/pricing)**​** The big thing here seems to be Right To Left language support. I take it for granted writing left to right, but this is a huge update for the RTL parts of the world. That said, here are a few things from 1.6 I wanted to share with you… My feature request from three years ago has been implemented Well, officially it's solved. I did a quick test and had some funky behavior. ​ Hide the ribbon I'm curious, do you use the ribbon on the left? I don't. But I'm really curious if you do. [Email me back "I use the ribbon" if you do.](mailto:hello@linkingyourthinking.com) Also, you can toggle the ribbon in Settings > Appearance. I just turned it off and I must admit, I feel naked now…I'll get used to the breeze, though. It's worth it for the extra real estate. ​ Way easier to remember and open vaults ​ We now have a smarter word counter This is a small touch but I'm so happy about it. ​ ​ Join me at the Second Brain Summit We are just four days away from ticket sales opening for the Second Brain Summit. I know from a very good source that there are more people on the waitlist than there are available tickets. Here's what you need to know: * ​[Make sure you've already joined the waitlist.](https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/summit)​ * Tickets officially go on sale at 6am pacific time on Tues 5/14 * Here's the current lineup… Having gone to other in person events recently, I now actively seek them out. They fill me up. I cannot emphasize enough the impact that in-person events have on the deepest parts of me. And I'm an introvert. I strongly encourage you to join us there. It's like, finally, a group of people who care about the same stuff I do, who think about the same problems I do, even if it's in wildly different fields and careers. ​ Writing Original Works Don't worry, enrollment is closed. Just a quick recap. Between our Knowledge Accelerator people and new enrollees, we have 286 participants. ​ Winner of the Golden Ticket: Alex Pinegger During our public event—[Livewriting 101](https://www.linkingyourthinking.com/raw-recordings/livewriting-101)—we picked a winner to attend WOW for free. All they had to do was share their mini essay (you can see how that looked at the 51:00 minute mark). We're happy to have Alex be a part of the WOW workshop. ​ What designing an online experience looks like Yesterday, I was designing the WOW experience and wanted to share a sneak peek into cohort design… I know about 95% of what I want to cover, but there is still a lot of work to do in creating the conditions of an experience that can lead to transformations small and large. Currently, I’m working on how to pepper in lessons from the curriculum into the first two live sessions, but it’s not a one-way street, because the exercises in the live sessions affect which lessons will unlock in the first wave of the curriculum. It requires all my focus. I enjoy it. I think I’m good at it. But it also means everything else in life is put on hold. Here's a glimpse of what some of that looks like. All the curriculum lessons are at the bottom. Then I'll migrate (by duplicating) the ones I'm covering in Week 1—placing them in my live "super" and "workflow" sessions. The red cards are exercises exclusively for the live sessions that don't show up in the curriculum. Hope that might be interesting for you. ​ Quick Hits I have tons of impactful things to talk about. Here's a running list for myself. * ~~Second Brain Summit~~ | Ultraspeaking | Supercharge Your Writing Efforts * Weekend Retreat | GrowBIG Training * Peerdraft But I'm out of time for this week. --- ​ Stay connected, Nick ​ P.S…If you missed it, we shipped [Obsidian Flight School 2.5](https://www.linkingyourthinking.com/obsidian-flight-school) last month. ​ ​ ​ **👣 Footnotes 🎵** The noise 💥 is deafening. I promise to focus on the signal 🌿. For me, the signal is high-value, evergreen stuff like: • how to think better and with more joy • how to be a better ***notemaker*** instead of just a notetaker • getting past the shiny surface and asking the deep questions • spotlighting 🔦 people and ideas that have stood the test of time ✨ |
