# LYT Workshop 4 is now open!

The "Linking Your Thinking" workshop started just over a year ago. Since then, we have served more than 300 members in 49 countries.

Do you want ***your own personalized, flexible, future-proof PKM system?*** A system that can give you peace of mind and tremendous joy? A system you can create and grow with‚Äîover decades?

That‚Äôs why I created the LYT Workshop. My mission with LYT is:

to empower and enfranchise a whole generation of people to think more critically, creatively, and connectively‚Äîboth today and far into the future‚Äîenriching their lives and the lives of those around them.

This is the value of smartly Linking Your Thinking: the ability to make meaningful notes across categories and throughout time.

By enrolling, you‚Äôre committing to a better way of thinking.
