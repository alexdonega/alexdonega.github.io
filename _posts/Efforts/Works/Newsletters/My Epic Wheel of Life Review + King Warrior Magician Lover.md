# I finally took a break
<br><br>It's rare that I feel like I've actually taken a break. Vacations don't usually count. You can go on vacations and feel exhilarated, but not really relaxed. We've now run 13 LYT Workshop and 1 WOW Workshop. Since I started Linking Your Thinking in the summer of 2020, it's basically felt like a nonstop sprint—especially at the beginning because I was working full-time as a TV editor while moonlighting LYT (moonLYTing hehe).<br><br>​<br><br>And I was going hard _before_ the pandemic. From 2016 to 2020, I was working hard enter the entertainment industry, starting out as a lowly production assistant, before finishing as a TV editor.<br><br>​<br><br>So in the past year, I've started to find more time for small breaks, usually in the form of weekend retreats with others, but not just by myself. _**Why is it so hard to firmly schedule time just to be with ourselves?**_ Well, for the past ten or so days, I've been on a major break. I haven't responded to anything. I haven't done any of the things I've grown accustom to doing. No tweets. No YouTube vids. I even skipped a weekly newsletter three weeks ago (don't tell anyone)!<br><br>​<br><br>One reason, was that I got sick, again. I've been getting sick more often. Hmm, that might be a signal. Sure, I'm not getting younger, but still, I don't like how easily I seem to get sick now. Too much working and too much sitting. So I decided to go on a personal retreat to the mountains. It was supposed to be from Friday to Sunday, but I extended it to Tuesday. It became a major life audit. I made so many discoveries and recognized so many short-comings in the person I aspire to be.<br><br>​<br><br>I did many exercises, some of which I'm not ready to share, but along with 40-minute long breathwork sessions that create a non-normal state of consciousness, personal journal entries, and vision work…there are four that I can share actual stuff with you:<br><br>​<br><br>- **A template for my Epic Wheel of Life Review**: I fine-tuned and expanded the Wheel of Life format to perfectly fit my needs and tastes.<br>- **A template for learning King Warrior Magician Lover**: These four archetypes were presented in 1991 and are based on Jungian psychology.<br>- **A walkthrough to properly install my new favorite Obsidian theme**: This is the AnunPuccin theme, initially modified by Sam Borgman, and further customized by myself.<br>- **A walkthrough showing the Rollup Method:** A powerful sensemaking method for gardeners and architects of seamlessly synthesizing freewriting and freetalking into higher-level insights.<br><br>​<br><br>Which of those do you want most from me?<br><br>​<br><br>Vote below… |

In the screenshots below, you can see a tiny peek at the **Epic Wheel of Life template** and the **King Warrior Magician template**. And you are looking at them in the new Obsidian template (it needs a name still). You can see how the light theme is like writing on calm paper.

Here, you can see how the dark theme is fun and tech-forward, but still welcoming.

The new kid on the block, "Relational" won the latest poll.<br><br>​<br><br>I use tools like Obsidian for a kind of **relational thinking**. There's a whole new exciting trend of people around the world doing amazing things with **relationship knowledge**.<br><br>​<br><br># Vote again!<br><br>You know, I call my PKM system my ideaverse. I encourage you to find whatever name makes the most sense for you. But technically, I still think Ryan J.A. Murphy coined the best term for it: Integrated Thinking Environment.<br><br>​<br><br>Integrated…that's a good term. What about **integrated thinking**? What about **integrated knowledge**?<br><br>​<br><br>Do you like that more or less than relational? Let's vote!|

You can see it at [notes.linkingyourthinking.com](https://notes.linkingyourthinking.com/). It's basically a digital garden. It was a sandbox of notes that gave guidance and ideas to PKM enthusiasts. Last year, I evolved the LYT Kit into a done-for-you PKM system called Ideaverse Pro.<br><br>​<br><br>But for the past two years, I've wanted more of a blog _and_ a digital garden. A digital garden itself is unappealing to me. I don't spend much time in anyone else's garden after the novelty wears off. Whereas, if there are clean and clear articles to read, I'm more likely to load up a few into tabs and save a few to (maybe) read later.<br><br>​<br><br>As our team has been designing this, it's led to so many questions about the nature and environment of idea transmission…I can't go into that now, but there is a balancing act here, with many questions. The ideaverse blog aims to synthesize the blog and the digital garden in a unique way.<br><br>​<br><br>Wish us luck, we'll share more soon.|
