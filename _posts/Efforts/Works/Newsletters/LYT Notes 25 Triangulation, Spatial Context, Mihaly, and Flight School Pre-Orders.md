This summer I made a video about how the graph view helps me think better. It was fun to rewatch it.

But I left out two crucial parts on "Triangulation" and "Spatial Context".

Both are helpful to understand why the graph view can be so powerful, so they are now in the full version of this video. Skip ahead to [**25:07**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=1507s&v=KuzBiqesNdo) to watch those parts.

## On miscellaneous things

* Any Obsidian CSS wizards or magicians out there? I created the Cybertron theme last year and have made ongoing tweaks, but I need help to refactor the CSS and improve the theme. If you think it would be fun to get together and geek out technically and creatively on Cybertron with me, the door is open, just email me.
* We hear about the ***arguments for*** social accountability, but talking about your unachieved goals can sometimes lead to a false sense of achievement. According to some research, it ["gives the individual a premature sense of possessing the aspired-to identity."](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/24354628_When_Intentions_Go_Public)‚Äã

## On Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi

Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi is one of my thinking heroes. I mean it. He's on my personal Mount Rushmore. He passed away last month at the age of 87. His ideas on "Flow" transformed my thinking. I corresponded with him once. That interaction continues to roil my soul (I will explain why someday).

If you read any personal development books after 1990, they are probably deriving some of their thoughts from Mihaly's work. Put down those derivative books that often only superficially understand Flow and go straight to the source. Pick up and read [Flow](https://www.amazon.com/Flow-Psychology-Experience-Perennial-Classics/dp/0061339202/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2960Q5QX74W8K&keywords=flow&qid=1636136568&qsid=139-7742198-3935221&sprefix=flow%2Caps%2C212&sr=8-1&sres=0061339202%2CB00RVRICW8%2CB07G4MD3MD%2C0712657592%2CB08QDLL5SJ%2CB0792J88LR%2CB083TMVLZP%2CB006UNHEZ0%2CB08Q693N8S%2CB000I52LVS%2CB07FYCRJ2R%2CB08Q6GCMPZ%2CB07FDJ3PYJ%2CB07TC852VV%2CB08Q5X4BX7%2CB07NQCLMZY) immediately. It is required reading.

Thank you Mihaly, I hope to write an adequate love letter in your honor someday.

üë£ **A LYT footnote** üéµ

The noise üóë is deafening. I promise to focus on the signal üåø. For me, the signal is high-value, evergreen stuff like:

* how to think better and with more joy
* how to be a better ***note-maker*** instead of just a note-taker
* getting past the shiny surface and asking the deep questions
* spotlighting üî¶ people and ideas that have stood the test of time ‚ú®

So until next time‚Ä¶ Stay Connected,

Nick

PS: A question I'm asking, ***"what tools and environments encourage me to create (or do) things I consider valuable?"***
