Near the end of 2020, I needed some space to think.

Like a lot of you, I was spending a lot of time in the same room, staring at the same screen.

The pandemic has affected all of us in ten thousand different ways. How it has affected you‚Äîand when‚Äîis different than how it has affected me. But AFFECT is has! I think one of the side effects of the pandemic is our shared understanding of this‚Ä¶So we can empathize a bit easier with others.

On one of these days of angst, I left the home and went for a ‚Äúdrive to nowhere fast‚Äù.

I just wanted some space for my thoughts.

Being in LA, I miss the open roads of Montana where I grew up, where driving on the Interstate is a gift of scenery, solitude‚Äîand oftentimes a free therapy session.

A lot of my best thinking has come from the open road. A lot. I missed that feeling, so I did my best to replicate it in the city on this day.

I hit ‚Äúrecord‚Äù on the phone and starting driving.

I quickly realized that my present ‚Äúangsty‚Äù mood was dominating what I was saying. Life was good overall, even if my present moment was down, and I didn‚Äôt really want to focus on it. So I actually went meta and started probing why.

*Why was the present moment getting all the attention in my recording?*

My present mood was only an indicator of the last hour. I wanted to talk about the last week, the last month, the last year. And yet my present mood was overtaking the recording. That led to a tiny Aha Moment for me.

*The mood of the moment is weighted too heavily* ‚ú®

Sure, we all know that.

There are great phrases built around that phenomenon like: ‚Äúthis too shall pass‚Äù, ‚Äúsleep on it‚Äù, and the ‚ÄúHot-Cold Empathy Gap‚Äù.

But ‚Äúknowing something‚Äù and ‚Äúacting effectively with that knowledge‚Äù are often not the same thing.

So that made me think about one of my favorite topics, ‚ÄúThe Environment‚Äù, and how *the environment shapes our behavior*.

Like jumping through a portal, I was in one of my favorite pastimes: **Sensemaking**.

I was trying to make sense about the ‚Äúforces that act upon us‚Äù, because it‚Äôs not solely the environment, there are other big things too.

Soon I was thinking about Time and Levels of Abstraction, Lenses and Gels, Pace Layers, and Ithaca Ax Handles.

Next thing I knew, I was halfway across the city.

Transported by the gift of thought.

The roads may have been busy, but my ability to think was now wide open.

Oh the joys of thinking!

It‚Äôs a superpower we all have, but sometimes it gets stuck in the mud.

When you are feeling some angst, like you are stuck in some mental mud, *how do you ‚Äúunstick‚Äù yourself?*

A shower? A run? Talking to friends or family?

As we enter the final month of 2021, here‚Äôs a friendly reminder to dedicate some time to having a ‚Äúgood think‚Äù.

I will be having a ‚Äúgood think‚Äù with Mike Schmitz next week.

You should consider joining.

Mike is going to cover three of his favorite sensemaking tools and guide us through exercises for each.

I too, am going to cover three of my favorite sensemaking tools and guide us through exercises for each.

It is on December 9th at 11 AM PT / [19:00 UTC](https://everytimezone.com/s/895854d0).

It is a LIVE 2-hour workshop. The agenda covers:

* Our examples & workflows of how we implement each sensemaking tool
* Live hands-on exercises where you actually apply these yourself
* An extended Q&A so you can get your questions answered

It is $59 to attend, but it‚Äôs not for sale until tomorrow.

If you want the link to sign up, you‚Äôll need to raise your hand and let me know.

‚Äã[ü§ö Yes please, I am interested in working my sensemaking muscles‚Ä¶](https://publish.obsidian.md/lyt-kit/Umami/Segmentio!)‚Äã

I will send the link tomorrow to everyone who has raised their hand.

If you‚Äôre not interested, you don‚Äôt have to do anything.

I know the benefits of working hands-on with masters of a certain craft. Many of my greatest joys working in TV was working hand-in-hand with a multi-Emmy award winner. It greatly accelerated my skills.

If you want to have fun exercising your thinking muscles, then consider joining us.

Life is never perfect, there are always things we want to do, or avoid, or change; but that doesn‚Äôt mean we can‚Äôt hold space for being grateful for what we do have in our lives.

In the US, it is Thanksgiving weekend.

It is a time where we are encouraged to hold space for having a mindset of being thankful for what we have in our lives.

1.5 years ago, there was no ‚ÄúLinking Your Thinking‚Äù. Today there is. It has exposed me to fascinating people from around the globe that mean something to me.

From Daniel to Bianca, and Yolanda to Francisco, and John to Deirdre, and Shawn to Sana, and Gary to Phil, and Cecilia to Jonathan, and Valerie to Scott, and Ellyn to Yalcin‚Ä¶I could literally go on for hours‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶I am grateful to have met all of you and shared deep, meaningful conversations with so many of you. I am also grateful have a role in helping you connect with other people who are diverse but share some things in common‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶a general kindness towards others‚Ä¶a constant curiosity‚Ä¶an excitement to connect with other inquisitive minds‚Ä¶a zest for sensemaking‚Ä¶and a joy in the very act of thinking itself.

For me, 2021 was the Year of the Note Maker.

To that end, it was an unmitigated success.

Here‚Äôs to our time together thus far, and‚Ä¶

Until next time!

Nick
