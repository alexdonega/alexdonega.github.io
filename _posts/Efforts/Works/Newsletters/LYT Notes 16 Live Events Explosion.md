## The LYT Kit, Version 5 - Live Walkthrough and Q&A

The LYT Kit has now been downloaded over 20,000 times.

But I've barely talked about ***how*** to use it. And how to think about it.

That's why I'm happy to finally share this with you.

* At this live event, the LYT Kit will be officially released for download.
* I'll provide an overview and walkthrough of the LYT Kit.
* I'll explain how the LYT Kit can help you figure out your relationship to knowledge.
* We will have a Q&A session all about it.

It's Sunday, August 1 at 10:00 AM PDT (UTC-7).

# The Linking Your Thinking Workshop

After Cohort 3 in January, I put a limit on the size of the next two cohorts.

Why? To preserve and strengthen the value the workshop can give you.

So we experimented. We added crews. We added guides. We focused on the signal and stripped away the noise.

Because here‚Äôs the thing‚Ä¶

As the number of participants increases, it is my responsibility to make sure that your experience doesn‚Äôt decrease. You are not a number. This is not a fast-food drive-through. I‚Äôm not about ‚Äúcash grabs‚Äù to sign up over a thousand people if it means you have a noisy, overwhelming and un-curated experience.

This workshop is laser-focused on ***your*** experience, your needs, your use cases, and your ***personal*** knowledge management system.

When you join a LYT Workshop, be confident that you will always receive MASSIVE value.

‚Ä¶And now, we‚Äôre ready for the next one.

Cohort 4 starts August 31.

Enrollment opens August 8.

Pre-enrollment is available if you attend the LYT Kit event on August 1.

If you are interested, [opt-in for LYT Workshop enrollment details](https://publish.obsidian.md/lyt-kit/Success%2C+you+have+opted+in+for+LYT+Workshop+enrollment+details) for Cohort 4.

They will arrive in the next week or so.
