"You know, like in Harry Potter."

Silence. A polite smile.

"Harry Potter?"

Nothing.

It turns out, there are still people living in the US who have not heard of Harry Potter.

I mean, I understand if you haven't cared to read the books or watch the movies‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶but to not even know of it?

What kind of person is this?

This person interviewed President Nixon while Nixon was still president. He has met with several of the Presidents/Chairmen of China. He has advised government officials in several countries. He has written 25 books.

And you've never heard of him.

He hasn't heard of Harry Potter‚Äîand‚Äîwe haven't heard of him.

What does that mean?

I don't know exactly‚Ä¶but it makes me want to be a little better.

It makes me want to stop myself from watching Yet-Another-Marvel-Movie.

It makes me question things.

I'm still questioning them days later‚Ä¶

In less than 4.5 hours, I'll be co-hosting a [live session on sensemaking](https://thesweetsetup.com/sensemaking-workshop-with-nick-milo/).

What if the world did less Marvel and more Sensemaking?

Is that really so crazy?

I'm not against Marvel movies by the way. I have enjoyed them.

But in high school we had an assembly for a traveling speaker.

His name was Milton Creagh and years later, I still remember his phrase.

"Enough is enough."

When it comes to the popcorn fare, the fun shows and movies, the things we mostly mindlessly watch‚Ä¶when is "enough" really enough?

What is a healthy percentage of mostly mindless consumption?

Maybe it's not zero percent.

But maybe it also shouldn't be the percentage it is right now.

What if it dropped just a couple percentage points?

What could you do instead with two hours here‚Äîtwo hours there?

I believe a world exists where you can know Harry Potter and Captain America‚Ä¶without making that your only reality.

Because there is another wondrous world out there for us to actively, deliberately, and meaningfully engage with.

We just have to make the time for it.

## On the emoji, and Dropbox's stunning lack of support

Love them, or hate them, the world is using emojis more and more.

| ‚Äã |
| --- |

Emojis may look crazy, but they are actually just Unicode.

*Unicode is an information technology standard for the consistent encoding, representation, and handling of text expressed in most of the world's writing systems.*

***But Dropbox doesn't support emojis in folders and filenames.***

Boo Dropbox! üëª

Help me convince them otherwise.

‚Äã[Please upvote my post to "enable emojis" on Dropbox's janky forum.](https://www.dropboxforum.com/t5/Dropbox-ideas/Enable-Emojis-in-Folders-and-Filenames-It-s-time-%EF%B8%8F-The-is-using/idi-p/561254) ‚Äã

They don't make it easy. You'll have to log into Dropbox first.

Plus, they initially hid my post, but it's been restored.

Let's put some pressure on Dropbox to do the necessary thing.

üë£ **A LYT footnote** üéµ

The noise üóë is deafening. I promise to focus on the signal üåø. For me, the signal is high-value, evergreen stuff like:

* how to think better and with more joy
* how to be a better ***note-maker*** instead of just a note-taker
* getting past the shiny surface and asking the deep questions
* spotlighting üî¶ people and ideas that have stood the test of time ‚ú®

So until next time‚Ä¶ Stay Connected,

Nick

PS: For those asking, the next LYT Workshop starts February 1st. You will hear more about it soon.

PPS: You can learn more about the state of emojis [here](https://blog.emojipedia.org/emoji-use-at-all-time-high/).
