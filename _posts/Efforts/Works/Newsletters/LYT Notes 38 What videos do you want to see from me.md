I've been thinking about thinking again. I know, sorry üòÅ

Can I share a few ideas with you?

(Are videos like this useful to you? If you watch it, ***let me know in the Youtube comments if you want to see more*** ***handheld drawing videos***.)

## Friends of Linking Your Thinking

Since you are subscribed to my newsletter, I‚Äôm going to consider you a friend.

Well, my friend, I created a sandbox where I can curate content for you.

**‚Äã**[**Rewatch my "Obsidian For Beginners" course**](https://friends.linkingyourthinking.com/t/obsidian-for-beginners/14). It is curated and has some commentary I just wrote.

**‚Äã**[**Watch some freebies from Obsidian Flight School**](https://friends.linkingyourthinking.com/t/flight-school-freebies/27) on Obsidian's display panels, a powerful plugin (what could it be?!), and some keyboard combos.

## What videos do you want to see from me?

Workshop 7 was a huge effort. The results for students filled me up ‚òïÔ∏è

Now‚Ä¶I‚Äôm ready create new videos.

But I have too many choices.

So I want to ask you‚Ä¶

***What videos do you want to see from me?***

‚Äã[**Vote here**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfq-xi1NI1IOEIHQ3YxiYqfoLkQ2Crj0F6u29fbhdYhVKYXjQ/viewform?usp=sf_link)- It will take 1 minute.

I will record the video that gets the most votes next!

## Yo, Workshop Alumni!

If you didn't join Workshop 7, you missed out on a lot.

The LYT Curriculum has evolved. It has WAY more value for you.

Here are the top 10 evolutions to the LYT curriculum

* **The 7 C‚Äôs of Note Making** in Unit 2 focuses on getting you practical reps
* **The Many Moves of the Map Maker** in Unit 3 packs more meat per minute
* **The Curriculum Map** - An alternative view for top-down thinkers
* **The Curriculum Checklist** - An alternative view for goal-oriented folks
* **The LYT Classification System** - A pre-built system to organize all your world's knowledge
* **I want to‚Ä¶ note** - The classic note, revised
* **Metadata** - New sections covering this topic
* **Queries** - New sections on queries in Units 1, 4, 5, and especially 6
* **Revamped Unit 5** - Connects every input to note-making
* **Revamped Unit 6** - I couldn't help myself, I added advanced awesome sections on sensemaking, including hefty explorations into the graph view.
  + How to use queries to track ideas, projects, and outputs.
  + How to use unrequited notes to confidently gather & resurface ideas.

And the best part?

You get it all for free. ***That's the power of "lifetime access"!***

Alumni, I'm going to email you directly in the coming days with a video walkthrough of all the changes.

‚Ä¶but you'll have to wait.

**Enrollment opens Sunday, May 22nd.**

There will be no pre-enrollment.

The changes from Workshop 6 to Workshop 7 were huge value additions.

And we already know how to make Workshop 8 even better.

It is going to be the best workshop yet!

You will hear more in the coming weeks.

üë£ **A LYT footnote** üéµ

The noise üóë is deafening. I promise to focus on the signal üåø. For me, the signal is high-value, evergreen stuff like:

* how to think better and with more joy
* how to be a better ***note-maker*** instead of just a note-taker
* getting past the shiny surface and asking the deep questions
* spotlighting üî¶ people and ideas that have stood the test of time ‚ú®

So until next time‚Ä¶

[[Stay Connected]],

Nick

PS: What can I do that you would like to see more of?

PPS: What do you want from me?!!
