## **On Damian Lillard getting the reps 🏀**

This Tuesday in the NBA, something notable happened on the court. Down 17 points with under 6 minutes remaining, Damian Lillard led his team to an improbable comeback win, scoring 20 points in the final quarter (and 50 points for the entire game).

But it was the post-game interview that I found the most notable:

**Shaq**: *To all the little kids out there, how do you become a lethal shooter?*

**Damian**: *I think it’s just putting a lot of time into it…that it’s a lot of* ***reps****…whether people are watching or whether you get credit for it or not, you just, you put the time in, and you do it at a game pace, you do it with focus, you do it…at the end of your workout when you’re tired (and you probably don’t want to do it): just things like that, over and over and over and over. Over the years.*

*You get better from the* ***reps****, but I think more so than just physically, you get better mentally and more confident in it because you’ve done it so often you don’t when you tired, you’ve done it when you didn’t want to.*

*And then in the moments, you know end of the game, whether it’s first quarter, second quarter, third quarter, a tough shot, the easy shot, you you got the ultimate confidence that is gonna go in and I think confidence is the biggest thing for shooters right next to just getting the* ***reps*** *in.*

…

Let’s re-strengthen and rebuild our thinking muscles. The good news is: just like our physical muscles, we can make big changes in relatively short amounts of time. We just have to get the reps.

How do you get the reps? How can you get better reps?

This is one of the most essential concepts to live by in my opinion. Here’s the note I have on [reps in the LYT Kit](https://publish.obsidian.md/lyt-kit/Reps). (Notice how it’s already exhibiting evergreen-ness by already connecting to Damian?)

## **On the Guided Program opening for enrollment tomorrow**

The “Linking Your Thinking”**guided program** is 6-week mostly self-driven version of the live workshop. It’s for those who can’t wait for the next live workshop later this summer.

Enrollment opens tomorrow on March 22nd.

*NOTE: We are limiting this to 30 people. There are no coupons or special deals for this program.*

The guided program consists of **6 units released weekly and 4 live sessions**, and it runs between **April 6th - May 18th**.

You’ll have to [opt-in here](https://publish.obsidian.md/lyt-kit/Email+Thanks) if you want to receive tomorrow’s email with ALL the details.

## **On the Anti-Tag 🏷**

The anti-tag sounds like some sort of super-villain, but it’s actually just another trick employed by a wily PKM’er.

Let’s say I use a daily note but after tons and tons of daily notes, my graph is useless. One solution is to have all your daily notes in a folder, like “Timestamps” and filter out that entire folder with the notation: **`-path:Timestamps`** `(like I emailed about last week).`

`You can also do this with an anti-tag. Imagine every daily note of yours has the tag "#my/daily. You can filter out all of our daily notes from a search by adding the notation:`

* **-tag:my/daily**

But depending on your needs, you may develop the desire to slice your notes with an even finer razor. Consider the following notation:

* **`#my/daily -my/journal`**

Using this search string, I can look at all my daily entries except ones with personal information that have also been tagged with the journal tag.

I'm not suggesting you do this, but it's worth knowing how you can use tags to NOT find something.

👣 **A LYT footnote** 🎵

The noise 🗑 is deafening. I promise to focus on the signal 🌿. For me, the signal is high-value, evergreen stuff like:

* how to think better and with more joy
* how to be a better ***note-maker*** instead of just a note-taker
* getting past the shiny surface and asking the deep questions
* spotlighting 🔦 people and ideas that have stood the test of time ✨

So until next time… [[Stay Connected]],

Nick
