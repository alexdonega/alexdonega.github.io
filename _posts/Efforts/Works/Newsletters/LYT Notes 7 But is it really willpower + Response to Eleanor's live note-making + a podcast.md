## But is it really willpower?

After a family dinner my dad reached into his pocket and pulled out dessert, a tiny box of Dots. He made a game out of it. We each got a dot. The game was to see who could keep it in their mouth the longest without succumbing to chomping on all the yummy goodness.

I don’t know what inspired my dad to play a game of “delayed gratification”, but I wouldn’t be surprised if one of his work colleagues forwarded him an email (a new thing at the time) about the famous Marshmallow test. If you’re not familiar with it, here’s the skinny:

> The Stanford marshmallow experiment was a study on delayed gratification in 1972 led by psychologist Walter Mischel, a professor at Stanford University. In this study, a child was offered a choice between one small but immediate reward, or two small rewards if they waited for a period of time. During this time, the researcher left the room for about 15 minutes and then returned. The reward was either a marshmallow or pretzel stick, depending on the child’s preference. (Wiki)
> In follow-up studies, the researchers found that children who were able to wait longer for the preferred rewards tended to have better life outcomes, as measured by SAT scores, educational attainment, body mass index, and other life measures. (Wiki)

So maybe my dad was curious to test his sons’ willpower. I remember having fun with the challenge, and I've wondered how simple challenges like that have influenced my attitude towards self-discipline and willpower over the years.

I was reminded of that fond memory by stumbling across this all too cute video on Youtube this week: [Don’t eat the fries until mom comes back](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkvscCU8N5A).

That’s some strong willpower!

…but is it really willpower?

I studied willpower (self-discipline) intensely over several years. Long story short, I was perturbed by some of the famous studies by Roy F. Baumeister et al where they used sugar water as a short-sighted way of “improving” a short-sighted view of willpower—in a way that subsequent research can’t replicate!

I still am a bit miffed about it all. Ha! But speaking of replication…let’s go back to that famous marshmallow experiment:

> A replication attempt with a sample from a more diverse population, over 10 times larger than the original study, showed only half the effect of the original study. *The replication suggested that economic background, rather than willpower, explained the other half.* (Wiki) (emphasis mine)

As you can tell, this gets me all riled up, but in a nutshell:

**Willpower is less controlled by your reserves of effortful resistance, and much more controlled by your environment.**

Hence part of my obsession with always thinking about how our tools shape us!

Because… *what are tools except for extensions of our environment?*

Here are two questions that might be fun to ask yourself:

* What have your main environments been lately?
* How are they influencing you?

## On Eleanor's note-making process

**Eleanor Konik**’s video has received an enthusiastic response from many of you, including a couple folks I know well enough to greatly admire their thinking.

> Passionate thinking is so powerful. You must watch this no matter how you’re taking notes. There are many, “watch me take notes” videos now on YouTube, but this one is bursting with insights. The best lesson I got from this (among the many) was making your PKM efforts be as intentional as possible. Eleanor is awesome, LYT is awesome - thanks for sharing this! - **Guthrie N.**

And this from **Joel Anderson**:

> The combination of passion, erudition, humor, Obsidian chops, and willingness to work with the garage door open makes this an exceptionally inspiring and useful video. Kudos! - Joel Anderson

Also from Joel's recap of useful lessons from the video:

1. Folders are very useful, particularly if you have different types of notes.
2. Meaningful, well-crafted headings are important – also for navigation.
3. Dataview has lots of potential. LOTS.
4. “Indexes are for when you get overwhelmed.”

Thanks again Eleanor for adding [such value](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nO5N_x2so0g) to the great conversation.

## On a podcast mixing PKM with focus

Over seven years ago I purchased a “field guide” from the venerable **Mac Sparky**. Over the years I’ve gone to “The Sweet Setup” to learn about the best apps and read the work of **Mike Schmitz**. It’s surreal to have just joined these folks I’ve admired from afar on their podcast “[Focused](https://app.convertkit.com/campaigns/5962757/steps/relay.fm/focused/122)” 🎙.

We talked about how to manage two different BIG careers / passions at the same time (not easy, but not impossible!). Plus we chatter about many interesting angles on the PKM movement sweeping the lands 💨

(I think I gave unexpected, but much deserved, shout-outs to **Francisco Bricio** and the **KillerWhale** 🐋.)

👣 **A LYT footnote** 🎵

The noise 🗑 is deafening. I promise to focus on the signal 🌿. For me, the signal is high-value, evergreen stuff like:

* how to think better and with more joy
* how to be a better ***note-maker*** instead of just a note-taker
* getting past the shiny surface and asking the deep questions
* spotlighting 🔦 people and ideas that have stood the test of time ✨

So until next time… [[Stay Connected]],
