*These LYT Notes aren’t just about spewing out 20 different shiny links to click on. They are about enriching our point of view on valuable things—long after we initially encounter them.*

*That’s why we’re adding some umami to “****Pace Layers****” 🌈.*

Since I mentioned Pace Layers [two weeks ago](https://publish.obsidian.md/lyt-kit/Spaces/LYT+Notes/LYT+Notes+1), your insights have enriched the concept for me. I especially enjoyed what Hojae L. and Mike B. had to say!

### **On Pace Layers and LYT frameworks (by Hojae L.)**

*(edited from Discord)*

*The article from Nick’s newsletter talks about pace layers in the context of civilization & culture. The original idea by Frank Duffy apparently thought of it in terms of architecture and buildings.*

* *Each layer of the Pace Layers has different “speeds”.*

> *“Each layer is functionally different from the others and operates somewhat independently, but each layer influences and responds to the layers closest to it in a way that makes the whole system resilient.” - Stewart Brand*

*One is not better than the other (In fact I think* ***it’s about how you need different layers*** *for civilization to be healthy….)*

*In terms of* ***LYT****, I can see how a Home note or higher-level MOCs can be considered “slow” layers because they take time to develop and “integrate shock”. Whereas, atomic notes can be considered “Fast” layers.*

**My take**

I’m so glad **Hojae** related Pace Layers to the **LYT frameworks**! For those of you who don’t know, the LYT frameworks are based around the idea of **“Idea Emergence”**:

> Idea Emergence is the process of how you the ideas you encounter go from the “nothingness” to the “somethingness”—and how those ideas grow in richness and complexity over time.

In this way, I have found Pace Layers to be a good fit to what’s happening in the LYT frameworks—except in reverse!

* You’re linking a bunch of small notes together. This is basically the fast-moving chaos of a zettelkasten…
* …which pushes you to create an emergent structure where you assemble several links into a higher-order note that we’ll call a **“Map of Content”** (**MOC**).
* …which over time leads to the formation of more mature, more convergent structures—like a Home note.
* But even as the Home note is being shaped from the faster moving layers, it can’t help but to subtly shape the faster moving MOCs it links to.

*And that’s how* ***Idea Emergence*** *beautifully exhibits the dynamics of* ***Pace Layers****!*

*Adding to our understanding of Pace Layers, Mike B. relates it to Time ⏳.*

### **On Pace Layers and the “Long Now” (by Mike B.)**

*(edited from Discord)*

*Stewart Brand's article mentions* ***“The Long Now”****. I wondered how Pace Layers related to this concept, so I found this from Brian Eno:*

> *“Now” is never just a moment. The Long Now is the recognition that the precise moment you’re in grows out of the past and is a seed for the future. The longer your sense of Now, the more past and future it includes. –* [*Essay: The Big Here and Long Now - Brian Eno*](https://longnow.org/essays/big-here-long-now/)*​*

*The quote resonates with me about* ***making notes*** *and building a* ***knowledge management system*** *as much as it does about having a “Long Now” view of life, the universe, and everything.*

* ***“Note making”*** *has long had the idea of* ***future-proofing*** *and making notes for your future self.*
* *Instilling a “longer sense of Now” into our notes and system, I think, is the key to making our notes resilient.*
* *And I believe it is a broader and better expression of how we should approach making notes, and I find it a little more poetic than future-proofing.*

*I also think there is something to pace layering regarding our time and interactions with our note-making.*

**My take**

I’m so happy Mike shared these insights around Pace Layers 🌈 and Time ⏳. Thanks Mike!

This makes me wonder:

* How can I incorporate the “longer sense of now” into my future-proofing?
* How well does a clock 🕰 represent the dynamics of Pace Layers and the “Long Now”, with the different paces of the second hand, the minute hand, and the hour hand?

My mind needs time to pace this out…

👣 **A LYT footnote** 🎵

The noise 🗑 is deafening. I promise to focus on the signal 🌿. For me, the signal is high-value, evergreen stuff like:

* how to think better and with more joy
* how to be a better ***note-maker*** instead of just a note-taker
* getting past the shiny surface and asking the deep questions
* spotlighting 🔦 people and ideas that have stood the test of time ✨

So until next time… [[Stay Connected]],

Nick
