**Readwise** is driving a lot of conversations lately.

First, they released a pretty slick integration with Obsidian. Then, they are in the midst of a beta of Readr, which looks like it will leapfrog related apps like Pocket and Instapaper.

I hosted Daniel Doyon and Erin Moore from Readwise during a live LYT House session last month. For everyone asking about the recording, it's finally available.

Our session covers a lot of ground, but the main focus is on the ***what, why, and how of the official Readwise plugin for Obsidian.***

## Flight School update

Thanks for everyone's interest in [Obsidian Flight School](https://lyt.ck.page/ace689c709). I can tell you, it's been a lot of fun to develop. I mentioned that this program will focus on improving your Obsidian skills in three main areas. One of those areas is "**Interfacing**".

"Interfacing" is the area we most think about with learning a new tool. Using the controls of the Obsidian interface is really the first basic step for anyone who wants to level up their abilities with the tool.

*Can I share any more details at this time?* It will be $99. It will be self-paced. It won't be for sale until the very end of the month.

üë£ **A LYT footnote** üéµ

The noise üóë is deafening. I promise to focus on the signal üåø. For me, the signal is high-value, evergreen stuff like:

* how to think better and with more joy
* how to be a better ***note-maker*** instead of just a note-taker
* getting past the shiny surface and asking the deep questions
* spotlighting üî¶ people and ideas that have stood the test of time ‚ú®

So until next time‚Ä¶ [Stay Connected](app://obsidian.md/Stay%20Connected),

Nick

PS: The next LYT House recording will be with Ryan J.A. Murphy where the focus is on the nature of PKM, information systems, and something called ITEs.
