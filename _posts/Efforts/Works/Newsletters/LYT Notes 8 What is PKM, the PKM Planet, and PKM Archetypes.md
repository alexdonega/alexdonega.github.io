(You are receiving this because you cherish good thinking.)‚Äã

If PKM could utter a single line, it would be this: *Through me, you make sense of the world.*

So what does that mean, and why should you care? Well‚Ä¶

Through better sense-making, you become empowered to create better, learn faster, work at a higher and more sustainable level, *and yet*, you are better able to stay grounded & focused as the world attempts to tear your attention apart.

## On the PKM Planet

Part of my obsession has been to figure out how to talk about all the ways people use ‚ÄúPersonal Knowledge Management‚Äù to do things. In the LYT workshop, we go through a PKM Pinwheel that helps us reflect on why and how we are PKM‚Äôing.

Today, I want to share a simplified version of that‚Äîaffectionately called the PKM Planet. In the graphic below, there are six distinct types of PKM, but there is also a sense of how even distinct use cases will almost always overlap with other use cases.

To make sense of this image, let‚Äôs run it through four PKM archetypes you might be familiar with‚Ä¶ I made a [walkthrough video on Loom](https://www.loom.com/share/cb552526798f4777abd0ac1714f1d0a0), but you can read through them below as well.

## Analyzing use-case archetypes using the PKM Planet

* **The top-down academic** (*PPM-driven*)
  + Having a thesis in mind (PPM), the collecting starts (PMM). Then arguments are developed (PIM). Eventually the writing (PWM) leads to a research paper.
* **The bottom-up academic** (*PIM-driven*)
  + Having a general sense of what to research, ideas are driving the work (PIM), which leads to organic writing (PWM), supported by the collecting of more reference material (PMM), with PPM as the underlying ocean current (but not the driving force).
* **The ‚Äúpublish or perish‚Äù content regurgitator** (*PPM-driven*)
  + Because of their drive to amass more followers online (PPM), they don‚Äôt ‚Äúwaste‚Äù time developing unique takes on ideas (PIM). Instead, they collect interesting ideas (PMM) and quickly regurgitate them (PWM) back online, polluting the airwaves but accomplishing their true goal of gaining more followers (PPM).
* **The life-long learner, aka the sense-maker** (*PIM-driven*)
  + Driven by a natural curiosity to learn, they organically connect ideas (PIM) and write about them (PWM)‚Äînaturally expanding their collection of knowledge (PMM), and advancing their unique value that they can apply to any project or goal (PPM).

Of course these are simplified archetypes, but hopefully they show you how to use the PKM Planet to map your own use cases!

What are some other PKM use cases that we can make into an archetype? Feel free to email me and share your thoughts. Here are some others maybe?‚Ä¶

* The project manager
  + PPM with PRM with PMM (and various degree of PIM and PWM)
* The goal-setter
  + PPM with PSM (and varying degrees of PIM and PWM)
* The novelist
  + PWM and PIM with PMM with PPM as the underlying ocean current
* The ‚Äúnon-regurgitating‚Äù content creator
* The language learner
* The spaced repetitioner

üë£ **A LYT footnote** üéµ

The noise üóë is deafening. I promise to focus on the signal üåø. For me, the signal is high-value, evergreen stuff like:

* how to think better and with more joy
* how to be a better ***note-maker*** instead of just a note-taker
* getting past the shiny surface and asking the deep questions
* spotlighting üî¶ people and ideas that have stood the test of time ‚ú®

So until next time‚Ä¶ [[Stay Connected]],

Nick

PS: *The Focused Podcast*: A bunch of you let me know I provided a bad link to the podcast last week. Here is the correct link: <https://www.relay.fm/focused/122>‚Äã
