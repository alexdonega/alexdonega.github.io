Joseph DiCastro blew our minds with his work visualizing the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (SEP). With the blessing of SEP, he took all the content from that amazing resource and created something really special.

I am so excited to sit back and watch this [video](https://youtu.be/xrz_TvdPcy4) with everyone LIVE in two hours.

## What is Obsidian Flight School üöÄ

Well, in plain-speak, it is an educational product designed to improve your ability to use the note application called Obsidian. But I get really excited about it because‚Ä¶

Obsidian Flight School is an experience-driven approach to learning.
It is an experiment in "curated but self-driven, non-linear education".

That makes it a big risk. Some of you will love it. Some of you won't. But that's fine. When it comes to teaching & training, I will never stop shouting "reps, reps, reps". If you really want to learn how to pilot Obsidian; then YOU have to pilot it. Watching videos alone is not enough.

Pre-sales will start Nov 7-18 for $99. It will launch on November 19 for $129.

Anyone who has signed up for the [Flight School waitlist](https://lyt.ck.page/ace689c709) who buys early will also be invited to a special live session on November 20 where I provide an in-depth overview of Flight School and will field as many of your questions as I can.

* Emojis are not going anywhere. Expect to see them continue to pop up in more and more PKMs in 2022.
* We are visual creatures. Just like emojis, expect the visual component of our PKMs to grow in 2022. Many intrepid PKM travelers are trailblazing the way with plugins like Zsolt's "Excalidraw".

üë£ **A LYT footnote** üéµ

The noise üóë is deafening. I promise to focus on the signal üåø. For me, the signal is high-value, evergreen stuff like:

* how to think better and with more joy
* how to be a better ***note-maker*** instead of just a note-taker
* getting past the shiny surface and asking the deep questions
* spotlighting üî¶ people and ideas that have stood the test of time ‚ú®

So until next time‚Ä¶ Stay Connected,

Nick

PS: If you use Obsidian and like plugins, you should check out the "Prompt" plugin by Hung-Su. Sometimes the simplest things pack the most punch.

PPS: As you are watching Joseph explain how he visualized the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, you might also want to [take it for a spin yourself](https://www.visualizingsep.com/#/entries/schopenhauer/).
