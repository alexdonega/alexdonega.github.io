The first time I heard the term "ITE" it both blew my mind and made perfect sense.

I first heard it from **Ryan J.A. Murphy**:

"The ‚Äúnotes renaissance‚Äù we‚Äôre currently experiencing is being driven by an explosion of apps that are, in fact, Integrated Thinking Environments."

**Ryan** works at the intersection of technology, psychology, design, and the application of those disciplines to the advancement of education. He uses design and systems thinking to search for strategic opportunities for change.

‚ÄãI'm always impressed and enriched by Ryan's perspectives, which is why I loved the LYT House session we did together.

Now it's finally available to watch (or rewatch):

You may have also bumped into Ryan in the Obsidian forum on Discord, where he is a moderator.

## Are queries relationship-builders?

Links are relationship-builders. So are folders. So are tags. I like to think of that triad as the primary relationship-builders in our PKM.

They are like the natural sciences.

So what about higher order notes like MOCs and a Home note? Well, they are more like the applied sciences‚Äîleveraging the primary relationship-builders in such a powerful way, that they too become relationship-builders. (I hope this isn't too geeky!)

In the same way as MOCs, queries are applied relationship-builders. But first, what are queries? I think of them as "saved searches" that you can have in a note. And they just passively assemble results for you. Very handy.

Something else I'm pondering:

**Q: How does using queries shape our behavior?**

Since I love using MOCs as active thinking tools, I definitely notice that using queries does two things to me: (1) makes my thinking more passive, and (2) makes me a janitor, trying to fix the metadata of my notes so the queries will display information better. üëà This doesn't happen when you manually assemble and collide ideas in a MOC because *you* are the one making every connection. And your brain benefits because you are forcing *your* neurons to fire and grow when you do this.

That doesn't mean that queries are not awesome. They are awesome to passively assemble results of a saved search. You can analyze or take action on those results. And that's valuable.

Just be aware of the pitfalls and adjust your course if you catch yourself in "Janitor Mode üßπ" for hours!

üë£ **A LYT footnote** üéµ

The noise üóë is deafening. I promise to focus on the signal üåø. For me, the signal is high-value, evergreen stuff like:

* how to think better and with more joy
* how to be a better ***note-maker*** instead of just a note-taker
* getting past the shiny surface and asking the deep questions
* spotlighting üî¶ people and ideas that have stood the test of time ‚ú®

So until next time‚Ä¶ Stay Connected,

Nick

PS: The next LYT House recording will be with Joseph DiCastro where he blows our minds with his work visualizing the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy‚Ä¶
