Hey everybody, it's time to take 2022 to the next level…

# Linking Your Thinking - Workshop 7

The “Linking Your Thinking” workshop is a 6-week program to overcome the traps of handling information and to build a custom knowledge management system you can trust.

It’s time to take your thinking game to the next level.

Enrollment is open from Jan 9 to Jan 25.

***Interested in the workshop?*** [***Opt-in here to receive the invite email.***](https://publish.obsidian.md/lyt-kit/Email+Thanks)***​***

*NOTE: In the past, enrollment closed shortly after it opened. We can handle more participants now, but we are still limiting enrollment.*

If you already pre-enrolled, you rock! The next "warmup" email is coming.

If you want to apply for a scholarship due to living in a developing country, or because you are experiencing financial hardship (or because you're a PhD student and you're apparently used to asking for scholarships)…you may [apply for a scholarship here](https://apply.linkingyourthinking.com/scholarship-workshop-7). Do NOT apply if you can afford the workshop; you will be rejected and removed from the list.

***Q: What are LYT House sessions?***

A: LYT House sessions are live conversations with fascinating people who inspire others with the quality of their thinking. We will explore how they think, what they do, and how they do it!

***Q: What makes a LYT House session special?***

A: It's the balanced three-part formula: Chat + Screenshare + Q&A

***Q: Can I attend?***

A: Yes. These sessions are open to the public.

***Q: Can I ask questions?***

A: Yes! Questions are compiled, up-voted, and saved for the last part. Come join and help shape the experience!

***Q: I can't make it to the live session. Will there be a recording?***

A: Make sure you register for the event. We might try to post a private link afterwards. This is not a guarantee. Please don't expect it, or email us asking "when is it ready???". You do not need to reach out. If you registered, we will keep you up to date. Also, several weeks later, it might be posted to Youtube, but no guarantees. It takes a lot of effort afterwards to edit the video and provide to definitive, Criterion Collection version.

👣 **A LYT footnote** 🎵

The noise 🗑 is deafening. I promise to focus on the signal 🌿. For me, the signal is high-value, evergreen stuff like:

* how to think better and with more joy
* how to be a better ***note-maker*** instead of just a note-taker
* getting past the shiny surface and asking the deep questions
* spotlighting 🔦 people and ideas that have stood the test of time ✨

So much is happening this month in the LYT-verse, it's pretty wild. I hope to see 👀you at some of these live events 🙌

Stay Connected,

Nick
