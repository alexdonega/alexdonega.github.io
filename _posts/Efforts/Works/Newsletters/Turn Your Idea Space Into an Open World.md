| We kicked off Writing Original Works this week. Very happy with it. Very tired too. After yesterday’s session I knew my brain was fried for the next several hours. Taking a walk would have been the healthiest thing to do, but I found myself returning to playing the game Zelda: Breath of the Wild. I’m approaching my time playing as a case study into my own psyche. * Why did I choose to go left instead of right? * How strong is my desire to stay on an intended course? * How do I wander? I like that last question a lot. If it’s a brand new area, how do I explore it? If I’m on horseback, I’ll be more likely to gallop through in complete freedom, moving fast and soaking in as much as I can. I’m more likely to ignore any enemies that appear. But I’m still drawn to shrines and towers. In this mode of playing, I won’t complete shrine’s puzzle, which slows me and isn’t always enjoyable; I’ll just activate it, which gives me the ability to teleport directly to it in the future. In this way, the shrines act as outposts on the frontier of discovery, allowing me to confidently gallop further. Towers are hard to not be drawn to. You can see them from far distances and climbing to the top of one also acts as a new teleport point. The difference with towers is that activating them provides a topographical map of the new region. Very nice to have. In this mode of exploration, the tower offers excellent views of the surroundings, so I look around, weigh my choices, then leap off and starting exploring in that direction. On my second visit to an area I rushed through initially, I take time to catch my breath. It’s more leisurely. If there’s a horse stable, I’ll talk to the folks there. I’ll climb on hills and mountains. I won’t mind fighting a few enemies. I’ll easily slip into side quests and new ideas of where to go next. I’ll pause a lot more just to look around and wonder. Why is this area here? Why was it designed this way? While I’m fascinated by this game for many reasons, a major theme is that it’s an open-world game, and ***even though I am mostly wandering around, I am gaining skills and abilities and accidentally acquiring powerful items***. Without trying, I went from my character being in his skivvies, to being adorned in the dress of the bird people, with the ability to teleport across the map and scale tall mountains. As I play in this open world game, I feel the parallels to how we learn and develop understanding in our own world. Just by wandering, we pick up new skills and abilities. Just by wandering, we gain interests and develop ides. Many of us intentionally develop our knowledge in dedicated idea spaces. I often call mine my ideaverse. Most generally, it’s our PKM system. So here are my questions for you: ***How can you make your idea space more like an open world?*** ***What would that do for your desire to enter it?*** ​ Quick Hits I still have tons of impactful things to talk about. Here's a running list for myself. * Ultraspeaking | Supercharge Your Writing Efforts * Weekend Retreat | GrowBIG Training * Peerdraft But because of the WOW Workshop, I'm out of time for another week. --- ​ Stay connected, Nick ​ P.S…If you're interested, I'm running my next course at UCLA this summer. It's called Supercharge Your Writing Efforts. I was able to make it remote again, but this will probably be the last time. [Feel free to learn more here.](https://www.uclaextension.edu/writing-journalism/screenwriting/course/supercharge-your-writing-efforts-script-x-4639e) ​ ​ ​ **👣 Footnotes 🎵** The noise 💥 is deafening. I promise to focus on the signal 🌿. For me, the signal is high-value, evergreen stuff like: • how to think better and with more joy • how to be a better ***notemaker*** instead of just a notetaker • getting past the shiny surface and asking the deep questions • spotlighting 🔦 people and ideas that have stood the test of time ✨ |
