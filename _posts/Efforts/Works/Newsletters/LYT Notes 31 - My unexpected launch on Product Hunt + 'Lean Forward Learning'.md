I'm kinda nervous because I'm launching Obsidian Flight School on Product Hunt, right now!

Three months ago I had no intention of ever launching something on Product Hunt, but the world is strange, and here we are‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶So, here I am asking a favor‚Ä¶

***Can you support today's launch on Product Hunt?***

It has 24 hours to make a big splash. Some of you know this already, but finishing in the Top 3 for the day means the product gets blasted to the Product Hunt newsletter, which is huge.

Ways you can help:

* Share the link on social media
* ‚Äã[**Support the page by going there and getting involved**](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/obsidian-flight-school)**‚Äã**
* Comment and provide feedback on the page

Beyond the upvotes, I'm particularly interested in your feedback since I'm pushing this paradigm for online education I'm calling "Lean Forward Learning". (The new youtube video that just released explains it.)

To make it easy to share on social media, here is a basic message template for you to edit:

* If you like Obsidian and want to get faster with it, you might want to check out this thing by @nickmilo called "Obsidian Flight School". It is a self-guided program with a starter kit designed to improve your skills and speed with Obsidian. <https://www.producthunt.com/posts/obsidian-flight-school>‚Äã
* Please make sure to add your personal opinions about it too (preferably the positive ones)!

## How to create an account on Product Hunt

It is easy. Go to [https://www.producthunt.com](https://www.producthunt.com/) and hit **Sign Up**.

Then choose one of the options (I just chose "Sign in with Google").

Finish the steps and now you have a Product Hunt account.

## The Linking Your Thinking Team

When I started the first LYT Workshop in June/July 2020, it was just a fun experiment. I did not know a single one of the 8 volunteers. All of them were just random avatars that I reached out to within the Obsidian Discord.

One of those 8 people was **Dan Lardi**. Even while taking that first workshop, Dan was suggesting things. He suggested I start a Youtube channel. So we collaborated on a series of 6 videos, and‚Äîlike a shot out of a cannon‚Äîboth the Youtube channel and our working relationship were off to the races.

Ever since, we've been a team of two. Fast forward to today and Dan is now an official part of the LYT executive team. He does it all but his main areas are "operations" and "marketing". There is plenty more to say about Dan, but that will be for another time.

I think back to before this all started. I was alone for so long on my PKM Planet, looking up to the sky, wishing for visitors to talk to about interesting things.

One day, a couple ships landed and we had nice conversations.

Now, there is an ongoing flood of fascinating and vibrant visitors. They are the people who joined the previous six workshops. And now they are a part of our private community. The brain power there is staggering. I hope to maintain a space that keeps many of them coming back because they continue to get value from each other.

That's why Dan and I are welcoming **Bianca Pereira** to the LYT Team!

Bianca is now the Head of Community Experience.

Bianca is a veteran LYT member and guide with a background in research and academia. She is focused on giving community members the fullest experience. There is plenty more to say about Bianca, but for now, we are just happy to be working with her as part of the team.

## Introducing the "Lean Forward Learning" Paradigm

What is the better way to improve at something?

Watching or doing?

Yes both are needed. But we improve the most by doing.

We already know this. A student living in Spain will learn Spanish a lot faster than a student watching Spanish videos online in their bedroom.

That's my intention behind **Obsidian Flight School**: to get people learning Obsidian by living in Obsidian. I call the paradigm: *Lean Forward Learning*.

Here is my video essay explaining how I designed Flight School with "The 6 Principles of Lean Forward Learning".
