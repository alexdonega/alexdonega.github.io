A few terse thoughts‚Ä¶

* You have limited time.
* You have an abundance of people you could listen to.
* Don't listen to people you don't respect.

## On the moral implications of sharing "content"

Here is a truth in today's digital world:

People who share fast and frequently gain followers, whether or not they are full of fluff‚Äîand a lot of them are full of it.

Many people who share "content" online are not sharing because they actually care to contribute to the world in some small way.

*They are sharing because they get more followers.*

Do you see the distinction?

One is about personal responsibility. The other just about that person.

I don't like those people because I suspect they are doing it for reasons I can't abide by: They are doing it for external rewards, not for internal ones.

They don't really care about others. They just want to "game the system". I'd like to think I can smell those get-rich-quick content creators a mile away.

However‚Ä¶we can't be too skeptical either. Too much skepticism leads to cynicism. I've been on the receiving end of some mean-spirited cynicism. It doesn't feel good. So we need to trust our gut, but also take the time to verify. Sometimes our impression of someone is actually based on too small of a sample size.

But also‚Ä¶we weren't born yesterday. We can easily identify scams about fake Nigerian princes these days. But how good are we at identifying the morally bankrupt content creators out there? I can think of about five at the drop of a hat.

If you are someone who wants to share content online, ask yourself why?

Is it just because it seems glamorous or something?

What is the main driver behind your compulsion to share?

* Is it a desire to help others, or a desire to just help yourself?
* Is it to positively impact others, or to pad your own pockets?

Not all sharing is caring.

If your spidey-senses are telling you someone is sharing for the wrong reasons, ***find someone else to listen to***. One of the side effects of living in the 2020's is that we have an abundance of people we can choose to listen to.

Surround your eyes and ears with people who you actually respect‚Äîand ideally like‚Äîeven if you disagree with them.

This is actually a good segue to a content creator I both like and respect‚Ä¶and will be co-hosting an event with in December‚Ä¶

## Six Tools for Better Sensemaking

**Mike Schmitz** is the Executive Editor of The Sweet Setup. He took a leap on taking the LYT Workshop in January. We got to know each other over the course of this year. We started chatting on the side and came up with something fun I'm excited to share with you‚Ä¶

What: ***Six Tools for Better Sensemaking***: Apply a set of thinking tools to help you solve the problems you encounter.

Here's what to expect over the span of this LIVE 2-hour workshop:

* Our examples & workflows of how we implement each sensemaking tool
* Live hands-on exercises where you actually apply these yourself
* An extended Q&A so you can get your questions answered

When: December 9th at 11 AM PT / [19:00 UTC](https://everytimezone.com/s/895854d0)‚Äã

Price: More than $50 but less than $100. *We are still figuring this out.*

When you ask the right question the answers become clear.

If you are interested in seeing our methods first-hand‚Äîand training your own sensemaking muscles‚Äîyou'll need to raise your hand and let us know.

‚Äã[Yes please, I am interested in working my sensemaking muscles...](https://publish.obsidian.md/lyt-kit/Umami/Segmentio!)‚Äã

If you're not interested, you don't have to do anything.

## On Cybertron

Any Obsidian CSS wizards or magicians out there? I created the Cybertron theme last year and have made ongoing tweaks, but I need help to refactor the CSS and improve the theme. If you think it would be fun to get together and geek out technically and creatively on Cybertron with me, the door is open, just email me.

***I am re-asking this because we switched servers so any emails you sent, I did not receive.***

## On using your brain‚Äôs associative powers for writing

***For Workshop Alumni only***, AS Renner is hosting a live creative writing event in four hours.

‚Äã [‚úçÔ∏è Use your brain‚Äôs associative powers for writing](https://forum.linkingyourthinking.com/t/use-your-brains-associative-powers-for-writing/4818). From AS (aka Anja):

I would like to show you a writing exercise by Gabriele L. Rico, which she describes in the book ‚ÄúWriting the Natural Way.‚Äù With this exercise, we can wonderfully experience the associative powers of our brain.
**About the schedule of the event:**‚Äã  
 I will give a small introduction to the exercise, and then we will try to put it into practice right away. Similar to what Nick did in his sense-making sessions.

**What you will need:**‚Äã  
You should use pen and paper for this. At least for the first part of this exercise, it is essential.  
You will need blank sheets of paper and a pen that writes smoothly. I prefer to use a fountain pen or a soft pencil.  
For the second part of the exercise, you could also use ruled paper, a journal, or your computer. You will have to test for yourself what works better for you. I prefer pen and paper.

Looking forward to seeing some of you there!

üë£ **A LYT footnote** üéµ

The noise üóë is deafening. I promise to focus on the signal üåø. For me, the signal is high-value, evergreen stuff like:

* how to think better and with more joy
* how to be a better ***note-maker*** instead of just a note-taker
* getting past the shiny surface and asking the deep questions
* spotlighting üî¶ people and ideas that have stood the test of time ‚ú®

So until next time‚Ä¶ Stay Connected,

Nick

PS: Questions I'm asking, ***"How quickly can I change my mental context? Is faster always better?"***

PPS: If you email me by replying to my last email, I did not receive it because we switched domain hosting around that time. Feel free to resend any emails you sent.
