You're receiving this letter because you recognize that note-taking is not enough. You recognize the growing value of note-making.

A few things have happened in the "Age of the Linked Note":

* We now have the ability to rapidly link notes together.
* We now can use higher-order notes like MOCs to gather, develop, and navigate our notes.

I won't begin to say how powerful this is. But I will say that many people are not taking advantage of their new superpower. Instead of using MOCs to generate insights, they are using them as manual index that they always feel required to keep updated. Instead of using them as next-level thinking tools, they are using them for janitorial work. They are like Spiderman using webs to pick up crumbs from the floor instead of using that power to swing across skyscrapers.

That's why so I'm excited to share this presentation by one of our members from the LYT Workshop, Jeremy Gavin. If you want to swing from PKM skyscrapers, then watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYVjzkjBeEA) because Jeremy shows a blueprint on how to generate tremendous value from exploring a topic using an MOC.

üë£ **A LYT footnote** üéµ

The noise üóë is deafening. I promise to focus on the signal üåø. For me, the signal is high-value, evergreen stuff like:

* how to think better and with more joy
* how to be a better ***note-maker*** instead of just a note-taker
* getting past the shiny surface and asking the deep questions
* spotlighting üî¶ people and ideas that have stood the test of time ‚ú®

So until next time‚Ä¶ [[Stay Connected]],

Nick
