*Here is the first part of the riddle* [*in case you missed it*](https://ckarchive.com/b/0vuwh9h8qwgo)*.*

‚Ä¶I had just written a lengthy riddle on a bathroom stall in our college dorms, and word reached everyone that I wrote it.

Then something amazing happened‚Ä¶

Everyone in the dorm would stop me and ask if they had the right answer. This went on for weeks!

They didn't click for the answer online.

The didn't cheat the riddle.

And it was a lot of fun.

That's the thing we keep forgetting: ***We are addicted to the answer.***

Even now, some of you are getting antsy because you have been conditioned to be spoon-fed the answers.

But it's not the answer that matters.

It's the riddle.

The riddle IS the answer.

It's a means unto itself, full of its own joy and fulfillment.

***Can you find the riddle in your work?***

## Building a second brain?

I previously mentioned being invited to speak at the Second Brain Summit last week. For those asking, there is a recording. It is an unlisted link but I'm pretty sure it's okay to share it with you: [‚ÄúThe Joy of Thinking and the Rise of the Note Maker‚Äù](https://www.youtube.com/watch?index=13&list=PLVNXAaej57W61wW9vtPNYPIuDnVQLP5TH&v=q0Pf6ZePNGc).

That happened because Tiago Forte decided to join the LYT Workshop. I was surprised, excited, and even a little envious. "Envious?" you say? Yes. I have been working so hard to spread the power and joy around link-based PKM, that I haven't really been able to be a student.

Like you, I love learning. Yes, we learn by doing. Yes, we learn by working with the garage door open. But I have been craving to just sit down (still *leaned forward)* and be a student. That's why I'm joining the BASB cohort as a student (For those wondering, there was no "special deal" or secret conversations. I paid in full.)

With LYT rapidly growing, I feel a growing responsibility to be knowledgeable in the broader **field of PKM**.

Yes, PKM is now a field! Because of us! Because of our interest and enthusiasm!

The cohort may or may not be for you. That's for you to decide. But if we believe effectively managing knowledge is an essential skill, then we need to make more people aware of the PKM. One of the best ways to do this, right now, is to [pre-order Tiago's book Building a Second Brain](https://amzn.to/3qH3MS3). (For those who woke up on the cynical side of the bed this morning, no, Tiago didn't ask me to promote his book. And no, I'm not receiving any kickbacks or perks from him.)

In our growing field of PKM, a rising tide raises all boats.

If you can, I encourage you to consider pre-ordering the book.

And I hope, you might pre-order my book, if I ever get to that point :)

## Our PKM movement continues

***It doesn't matter if you are a doctor or a dungeon master.***

Link-based PKM is causing a revolution.

It's a movement built by your deep springs of enthusiasm.

I have a lot of questions to ask you.

***How can I be responsible in helping guide this movement?***

* Would you like to see a youtube series about XYZ?
* What BLANKS would you like me to talk about?
* What would you like to see in the upcoming **LYT Kit 6**?
* What would you like to see in **Obsidian Flight School 2**?

What else comes to mind for you?

## LYT Workshop 7 comes to a close

We took over 200 people through the ultimate PKM accelerator program.

The wave of progress students made is hard to comprehend.

I love our workshops because students roll up their sleeves and start wrestling with questions they didn't even know they needed to answer.

I'll try to share more later‚Ä¶still recovering the cascade of Aha Moments!

üë£ **A LYT footnote** üéµ

The noise üóë is deafening. I promise to focus on the signal üåø. For me, the signal is high-value, evergreen stuff like:

* how to think better and with more joy
* how to be a better ***note-maker*** instead of just a note-taker
* getting past the shiny surface and asking the deep questions
* spotlighting üî¶ people and ideas that have stood the test of time ‚ú®

So until next time‚Ä¶

[[Stay Connected]],

Nick
