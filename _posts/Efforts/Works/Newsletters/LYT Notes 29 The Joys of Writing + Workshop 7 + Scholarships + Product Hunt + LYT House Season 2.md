Where do creative breakthroughs come from?

In the following video, Rok Sanda takes us on a riveting writing journey. Along the way, we will see if he heeds the advice to ‚Äúalways listen to your characters‚Äù. Perhaps most interestingly, we will see where he drew serendipitous inspirations from in life‚Äîbecause those inspirations led to compelling breakthroughs.

After watching, I think you‚Äôll agree, Rok‚Äôs process is a joyful thing.

## LYT Workshop 7

The next workshop starts February 8th.

You can‚Äôt enroll just yet, but for people who want to purchase before the end of the year, we will have a two-day pre-enrollment window Dec 28-29.

So if you are positive you want to enroll in Workshop 7‚Äîand want to purchase before the end of the year‚Äîbe on the lookout on the 28th.

## Scholarship Applications for Workshop 7

We are averaging 25-30% scholarships per workshop. I‚Äôm very proud of that. We have every intention of keeping those percentages high. The scholarships we award are for hungry and curious people in developing countries first and foremost, although we also consider personal hardships‚Ä¶

In the past, we opened scholarship applications *after* the main enrollment period. That ensured fewer people felt compelled to apply if they could just afford to pay full admission. This time however, we are opening scholarship applications early to make life easier on the review team. Speaking of which‚Ä¶

All scholarship applications are read by our Scholarship Review Team. They are all volunteer workshop alumni, some of whom received some part of a scholarship themselves. We take all applications seriously and the majority of applicants are not accepted. So if you intend to apply, make sure you ***really*** can‚Äôt afford the workshop. Sometimes we receive an application from someone can afford the workshop, but they just applied to catch a break. We don't like that. No one likes someone trying to take advantage of goodwill. It does a disservice to the people who ***really*** need assistance.

So if you are a hungry, curious, and giving thinker in a developing country or you are going through a personal hardship‚Äîand you ***really*** can‚Äôt afford the workshop, you might consider applying for a scholarship for Workshop 7 [here](https://apply.linkingyourthinking.com/scholarship-workshop-7).

## Do you have any experience with Product Hunt?

Obsidian Flight School‚Äîthe ‚Äúforce you to learn by doing‚Äù educational product‚Äîhas had over 300 people purchase the early version last month.

On Tuesday, January 4th, we are officially launching it.

Our hope is to launch it on **Product Hunt**. Is that crazy? Does anyone have experience with this? Any ‚ÄúHunters‚Äù out there?

We could use some help.

***Please reply to this email with any experience or insights you have with product launches on Product Hunt. Any help you can provide is very welcome.***

A big reason I want this to be a success on Product Hunt is so people in other fields hear about it and get inspired to consider how they might be able to provide a deeper learning experience in the products and services they provide.

To that point, I truly believe the design of Flight School is just the beginning of a deeper level of learning. Sitting back and passively watching instructional videos is easier, but the results are far less powerful. Instead, the ‚ÄúFlight School formula" forces you to grab the controls and pilot the ship.

Is it scary? You bet! Kinda like when my dad put my older brother behind the wheel of an old Ford pickup truck for the first time on a winding mountain road, and yours truly was a frightened nine year old with my eyes fixated on the cliff edge just to the right. But we turned out alright, right? Right? Bueller?

I digress‚Ä¶

There are multiple forces at play in the Flight School formula but this form of education can be described as:

* **Non-linear**: It's a ‚ÄúChoose Your Own Adventure‚Äù.
* **Non-passive**: You are forced to actively engage and immerse yourself with the exact thing you are trying to learn.
* **Built-in repetitions**: The very nature of the program builds in inescapable hands-on repetitions with the tool you are trying to learn.
* **Uncomfortable**: Again, the very nature of the program means that the adventurer will be uncomfortable, challenged, and sometimes even frustrated. That‚Äôs when the deepest, stickiest learning happens! Those are "deep reps".

Hopefully that resonates with you and we can amplify this form of teaching on January 4th.

## LYT House Season 2

In our inaugural season of LYT House, we had six live events that had pretty cool mixtures of interviews, screenshares, walkthroughs, and live Q&A‚Äôs.

Well, Season 2 begins Dec 29th at 9:00 AM PST / 17:00 UTC. The season will end by Jan 18th.

So far you can expect to join sessions on visual thinking, color theory & design, and emotional learning.

The lineup is almost complete but ***feel free to suggest someone you would like to see in the LYT House.***
