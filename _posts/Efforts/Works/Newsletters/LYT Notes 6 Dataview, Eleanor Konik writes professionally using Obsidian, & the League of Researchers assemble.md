## On powerful queries with “Dataview”

Have you heard of this powerful community plugin by Michael Brenan? It allows you to do some cool queries with your mass of notes. Rather than type the details, here’s a screenshot for you to unpack:

“Dataview” is powerful and there are many ways to use it. I’m using it in a basic way to keep track of my projects. But you are seriously only limited by your imagination.

Speaking of which…

## On writing professionally using Obsidian (Youtube)

If you are wondering how to take the things you encounter and turn them into a captivating, unique, and finalized product—you’ll get quite a bit out of this live note-making session with **Eleanor Konik**. [Watch it here](https://youtu.be/nO5N_x2so0g).

In this live note-making session, Eleanor takes us on a journey into how she researches, generates questions, makes connections, and creates products that she gets paid for.

* We’ll see how she uses the powerful dataview plugin.
* And we’ll leave with a creative process that works for writers of fiction, non-fiction, articles and everything in between.

This is paradigm-shifting folks. If you are a writer or world-builder, using link-based frameworks can unlock a whole new world of creative vitality. 🤩

Our presenters are:

* Sam (Cohort 1)

## On the Guided Program selling out in 10 hours

WOW! We exceeded the limit of 40 participants just 9 hours and 52 minutes after it opened! Enrollment shut down much earlier than expected.

I’m excited for “Cohort 3A” because—***surprise***—there are several inspiring alumni volunteers who will be acting as Crew & Event Leaders—adding even more value than was promised!

If you missed out on the rush and want to join the next Guided Program, join this [waitlist](https://lyt.ck.page/d2e0ead999) to be at the VERY FRONT of the line for Cohort 3B, which starts June 1st.

👣 **A LYT footnote** 🎵

The noise 🗑 is deafening. I promise to focus on the signal 🌿. For me, the signal is high-value, evergreen stuff like:

* how to think better and with more joy
* how to be a better ***note-maker*** instead of just a note-taker
* getting past the shiny surface and asking the deep questions
* spotlighting 🔦 people and ideas that have stood the test of time ✨

So until next time… [[Stay Connected]],

Nick
