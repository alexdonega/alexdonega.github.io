Obsidian changes the game by being a note-taking app, a note-making app, an app to rapidly work with text, a familiar way of thinking, and an entirely new way of thinking.

It's actually more than that too. Ryan J.A. Murphy opened my eyes exactly what Obsidian is (it's in the video)‚Ä¶

There are many note apps out there‚Ä¶but among them‚Ä¶

Obsidian is one of one‚Äîwithout equal‚Äîan app of apps.

In this love letter video, I explore the 8 ways Obsidian is changing the game, its 2 key drivers, and yes: what Obsidian REALLY is and what YOU can do with it!

She is going to give a grand reveal of her (sanitized) vault for people to see.

We will explore PKM, LYT, nonfiction studies, fiction writing, creative inspiration, and rigor.

We will talk about: managing writing projects and tasking, slight peeves with folders, Eleanor's "inbox", CSS, cool new plugins like QuickAdd, tags, and who knows what else!

üë£ **A LYT footnote** üéµ

The noise üóë is deafening. I promise to focus on the signal üåø. For me, the signal is high-value, evergreen stuff like:

* how to think better and with more joy
* how to be a better ***note-maker*** instead of just a note-taker
* getting past the shiny surface and asking the deep questions
* spotlighting üî¶ people and ideas that have stood the test of time ‚ú®

So until next time‚Ä¶ [[Stay Connected]],

Nick
