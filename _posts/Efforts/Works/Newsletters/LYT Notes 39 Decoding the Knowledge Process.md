You voted and here's what you want to see most from me:

* Obsidian "Continue Here" Series - The sequel to the "Start Here" series

So I will work on that next. Then "PKM Planet 2".

In the meantime this is brand new: **The Knowledge Loop is ENCODED…**

## 🛠 For the advanced users

If you are new to linked thinking and Obsidian, skip this section.

Zsolt Viczián is doing brilliant work incorporating the view from the app called The Brain into Obsidian.

I don't want to speculate, but the implications of a local graph view in this style is exciting. For now, check out the screenshots in this tweet thread. Then if you are still curious—and an advanced user—check out Zsolt's Youtube video on it.

👣 **A LYT footnote** 🎵

The noise 🗑 is deafening. I promise to focus on the signal 🌿. For me, the signal is high-value, evergreen stuff like:

* how to think better and with more joy
* how to be a better ***note-maker*** instead of just a note-taker
* getting past the shiny surface and asking the deep questions
* spotlighting 🔦 people and ideas that have stood the test of time ✨

So until next time…

[[Stay Connected]],

Nick

*"What would you not have accomplished if you had been free?”*
*The wise Abbe replies,*
*"Possibly nothing at all; the overflow of my brain would probably, in a state of freedom, have evaporated in a thousand follies.*
*Captivity brings light to the treasures of the human intellect, just as compression is needed to explode gunpowder.*
*From the collision of clouds electricity is produced; from electricity, lightning; from lightning, illumination."*
- 1844 📚 The Count of Monte Cristo

That quote stayed with me for years.

Eventually, I expressed it in my own words:

 All are free to choose their thoughts.
Some are free to choose their pursuits.
And a few so free that they are enslaved in pursuit of their follies.
