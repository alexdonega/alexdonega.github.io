###### 1

okay this one is long overdue I realize I've been doing YouTube all wrong and it's led me to burnout this video is going to be a lot different than my other videos I'm not going to do any walkthroughs or tutorials it's mainly going to be about how I became an accidental Creator there are some creators that want to be creators there are others that are accidental you had something going on you kind of fell into this world and for me I fell in pretty far so yeah this video it's it's more of that reflection of like how I got here how I burnt out how the team really burnt out too and everything that we're

###### 2

trying to do to make things sustainable in the future and really what that means for you as far as what you can expect from me on this amazing linking your thinking channel so hey I I don't expect you to watch all this but if you are interested in such things hey let's let's get into it I'm an accidental Creator I'm somebody who was just kind of like back peddling and then fell back backwards into the party and then looked around and said whoa what's going on here uh I was happily in TV working my way up as a TV editor and the last show I worked on was better call SA which is at the top of the game nominated for I think over 50 emies like this was the best show ever the people on it were super creative and kind I was in my happy place working on this show I created a Fitness Boxing business along with my friend and business partner Garrett girls we co- founded a Fitness Boxing business that's become International it's called pink gloves boxing it's still running today and I'm really proud of that and then around

###### 3

2013 I moved from Montana to New York City I got involved at HBO and a bunch of different things and I was a PA so I was the person who would have to shlep soggy cheeseburgers across town for lunch and grab the producer random coffees and cappuccinos whenever they wanted that so not the most glamorous thing but I was finally able to be in an environment much like school where you can just learn and this time though I was getting paid to learn so I was soaking up everything and then I went up to become a post coordinator and then I had an opportunity do I do I want to be a post- production coordinator or do I want to start editing and I chose the editing track and next thing you know I'm working on Breaking Bad the movie and then better call saw the final season so this was all happening and yet with the pandemic I started sharing content about how to take better notes how to link notes together how to make these special things called maps of content that allow us to think better than ever before and uh this

###### 4

whole new world opened up and it was being a Creator being a part of this Creator economy and I just had no clue what I was in for I had no idea what this Creator economy was and this was in 2020 fast forward to today it's middle of 2024 and I've just come back from VidCon in Anaheim California out outside of Los Angeles and it's finally 4 years later that I'm understanding the immense massive vast Creator economy for what it is like I'm just this like tiny little thing over here and and the rest of it's like just everywhere else and I'm both in it and also not in it and it's taken me four years to realize that I've been doing it all wrong I've been doing YouTube wrong I've been doing all this Creator stuff wrong I've been doing a couple things right because you know even a broken CL is right twice a day and I think I got a couple things right I got the uh The Weekly Newsletter right and um we we got our um month-long cohorts our workshops right but outside of that um YouTube I've have gotten

###### 5

it all wrong because I'm just trying to like kind of like promote the stuff that we've been doing in the workshops and all that as opposed to just having fun creating cool content that I think might be helpful and be educational for others seeing what resonates and continuing to to to share those types of things so that's what I'm hoping to move towards now it's been a journey realizing that not only am I an accidental Creator but finally I think I can call myself and embrace myself as a YouTuber and I started to share this geeky hobby of mine which was to to uh make notes and Link notes together something I've been doing for years and years so during the pandemic we had extra time on our hands so we started to edit TV shows from home and so I'd be here editing but in then in my free time i' would be hopping on the forums for this application called obsidian and I'd be nerding out on things like Knowledge Management how to take and make better notes and Link those notes together and and I found this thing that I thought was

###### 6

amazing yes we we were just starting to be able to link notes to other notes and everyone was saying we don't need folders anymore we don't need structure anymore let's throw all that away and we'll only link a note to another note and we'll just kind of go through these these paths clicking from one note to another to find anything we want and I felt that while that was awesome we still needed another level of structure and so I I shared this thing that I thought was really helpful which were these Mappy notes maps of content and that allowed kind of like these hubs that would have links to all these different notes and instead of just being an index though these notes really came alive and we could start working with them and they became this really organic thinking space um a digital Garden of sorts and this was exciting so I shared um a free set of notes and it was a starter kit and people could download these notes and you still can they've been downloaded I don't know how many times at this point but like about 880,000 times and then

###### 7

when you open them up in an app like obsidian you can see all the links and you're starting from this sandbox of notes that you can figure out what's going on you can experiment with and you can find out how it can help you learn better think better make better sense of the world remember things plan your day and everything in between and that that's where things kind of get interesting so at that time um I ran my first cohort and I just asked people from the online communities hey would you want to join this cohort and 11 people who didn't know me you know I wasn't in this industry at all and they just said um they they just took it on faith that I might have had something worth sharing and so they joined this coort and it was an experimental six- week thing and it went pretty well so one of those people lard is part of our team now and and Dan's like hey I think we you have something here I'd love to develop it with you and so we decided to do our second cohort in October of 2020

###### 8

and my goal is just to get 12 paying customers and we ended up getting 55 and I thought wow we have something major here and the leadup to that cohort was a series of YouTube videos so I think it was September of 2020 we shot our first six YouTube videos how to use obsidian beginner series it's now been watched over 2 million times and even though it's a little out of date it is still bringing people into the right mindset and Ethos about how to approach our notes how note making and linking notes together can bring us so much meaning and intention into our lives allowing us to live with more fulfillment in everything that we do so that was great but that cohort was so successful I ran another one in 2021 that one had 110 people and now We've ran 13 or 14 in total and now the average is 200 to 300 people per month-long cohort that we run and while that sounds awesome I've realized more and more that the cost is I'm not able to communicate to everyone on YouTube and share what I'm excited about something happened with all

###### 9

these month-long cohorts they're intense so there's not just a month-long cohort of live sessions from a global audience but there's the campaign leading up to it talking loudly about that everywhere that's possible and in the process of all this I have so much stuff that that I want to share with you that I that I get excited about but because of of the cohort and the demands of like trying to get people over here all of our attention went there and what little time we had over here to make YouTube videos it was only to basically give updates about what's going on over here or to like say hey you might be interested in this stuff either our cohorts or like the different products that we have U we have a done for you starter kit of Link notes but we also have um a training tool for obsidian so we have all these different services and products and we're so busy doing the stuff and making super amazing experiences that that create tons of aha moments and really help people out but therefore 200 or 300 people at a time and meanwhile everybody else

###### 10

here um they only get every now and then a YouTube video and because we weren't making YouTube videos we started to kind of repurpose interviews so tons of you are subscribed probably because of something to do with notem making with uh PKM personal Knowledge Management and likely also with obsidian and yet a lot of these videos that we post are random interviews or also something I like but no one else seems to like uh cool video essays on things like the five decade rule or not Wars these are videos that you probably haven't watched but I've been pretty happy about making except no one's watching them so we have interviews we have video essays and no one cares about these things and because we're so busy over here delivering cool experiences and making new products we don't have time to just share really interesting fun YouTube videos that hopefully give you something awesome that you can take with you um after you watch the video like immediately so long story short so much time in delivery means not enough time sharing and communicating the stuff that really gets me excited and that's the realization I've

###### 11

come to that I want to spend way more time just communicating things that I think are great the advice that I'd give to anyone who's on this Creator path or to my younger self is is really that it is great to be in the lab it is great to be creating stuff oh I love it the development of everything and that's what's spawned off so many awesome products that we now offer um the the cohorts these live workshops have been freaking amazing and I love the experiences the interactions and the AHA moments all that stuff however is super high intensity super demanding and it's all back of stage meaning that there's this entire world over here this entire ecosystem of YouTube and all these different platforms endless endless people and relationships that we can build but we just create this wall and say nope only those of you who who can make it over here about 200 to 300 at a time can get all this experience and while we need to maintain that to some degree we need to lessen the amount of time and effort we put there so we can honor these

###### 12

relationships so we can talk to everybody and really Elevate what you can accomplish here that's the hope so so the big advice and takeaway is after you kind of figure out what your thing is and you need to be in the lab to do that you need to somehow go from more time back a stage to more time front of stage that is crucial so as a team that's where we are now we're trying to recalibrate how we spend time back of stage with front of stage back of stage oh that's where relationships are made like the deep intimate meaningful ones that last a lifetime so I love that at the same point we need to have front of stage presence we need to be able to communicate what we're actually doing what gets us excited what gets me excited I want to share all these things W with you right here right now and so that's the balance and so I've been doing YouTube all wrong because I've been trying to promote back a stage stuff and just like Hey we're doing this cool thing over here hey we're doing this cool thing over

###### 13

here but what we really need to do what I need to do is just say what I'm excited about that doesn't have to be a shoehorn I'm not trying to like shoehorn you into the next product or service instead I just want to share what what gets me excited because I know that there's a lot of value there or at least I my my hypothesis is that there's a lot of value there and maybe uh that resonates with you and if so you know you'll you'll like it you'll you'll comment you you'll engage and hopefully we're all better for it so that's the big takeaway there and the funny part though is I I talked about just where we're spending time on this backstage stuff on the delivery of of cool workshops and cohorts and making products but that it doesn't end there the next thing is it's all about sustainability and we've been burning ourselves out because not only does backstage not even reach as many people but it is super time and energy intensive and we just go from one to the next to the next and so we've been burning ourselves out

###### 14

here at the end of every cohort every month-long Workshop that we run we we uh we alternate sabatical weeks like we need the sabatical weeks like a complete week and that happens three times a year that we do just to just recover from all the efforts happening here so we've been on the edge of burnout and what I did this year which was kind of a mistake but also useful but still we really pushed it so I'll take you back to the end of 2023 and we were you were already straddling the edge of burnout and I said okay okay team we are not going to do our summer cohort of the linking your thinking

###### 15

Workshop instead we're going to keep that time open for who knows what something creative will will I'm surely fill that Gap and so we'll we do the one in February and we'll do the one in September and October and we'll keep the one in the middle of the Year free 2 weeks later I was like you know what here's what we're going to do 2024 we're going to have four cohorts and we're going to have a new one in the middle of the year it'll be called writing original works and then we'll have one during uh you know nanoro the national writing month instead we're going to have our spin on it and it'll be notem making it'll be a month of notem we'll call it notem making Mastery so instead of doing less somehow in 2024 we're doing more and it was that last Workshop that brand new workshop writing original Works which is basically how to make writing easy using link notes I'm so proud of our product that we did for that like the amazing service that we that we provided for everyone backstage but it burnt us out I mean just

###### 16

right now we're just recovering from something that finished about a month ago that was intense and it's really allowed me to real realize that this type of stuff isn't sustainable uh we need to stop trying so hard to get people backstage and just communicate more and more of the things that we care about that I that I value front and center more consistently with you that's going to help provide more value to everyone here but it's also going to help us not burn out so much this backstage stuff is tough now I'm not saying in front of stage is easy but if we're just sharing from the heart if we're not worried about perfectionism like having perfect delivery of something that usually happens over here because at that point people are paying a lot of money they deserve like the the best products and services possible but over here on YouTube we can just be more loose and provide value as we go and so that is going to be the new me that's going to be the new Wii that's going to be where we want to go if if we can get into

###### 17

those habits then we're going to find a more sustainable route so that's a really important thing so the big takeaway here is you need to have time to zoom out we get so fixated on our patterns that we get into and our world becomes so small and narrow if you don't have dedicated time to zoom out you're going to get stuck in these patterns that keep on repeating and typically whatever was there like whatever opportunity is not going to say stay the same size it actually might start getting smaller over time because you're just kind of in the same rut and you're just kind of SP spinning your wheels in the same rut instead what you need to do is zoom out and we'll have other videos on this channel in fact by this time I might be able to link to one up here and it's going to be about an Epic Wheel of Life review like you need to have time to go on a personal Retreat and do a life audit and get this like zoom out on your life go to a different space and that is going to lead to

###### 18

so many more aha moments and deeper calm and understanding than simply doing the same stuff that's leading to burnout I want to dig in a little bit to the feeling of burnout because if you're someone who watches YouTube you've probably stumbled across some type of creator that maybe has completely ghosted the platform or has acknowledged that they've burnt out uh this thing is real and it's it's not just on YouTube but it's for anybody in this Creator economy who is consistently sharing something somewhere now uh for me I have a Weekly Newsletter and I've been fairly consistent with that and that is basically my my North Star if you're in the northern hemisphere if you're in the southern hemisphere Southern Cross it's that thing that I can look at and make sure as long as I'm doing that something's working and so far I've been able to do that for the most part yeah every now and then um I miss a week but it's been able to mostly work it's this other stuff though it's like I I know I have to do another YouTube video but we're doing this work you know we're

###### 19

doing this cohort so there's this feeling that there's never enough that I can do and I'm trying to do so much so typically what happens is I end up drinking more coffee all right so I drink more coffee then I crash in the afternoon so I have more coffee but as I'm crashing and everything like there's this mind game that's happening where I'm like I'm so low energy and everything feels hard and there are all these people I have not communicated with like there are so many emails going un unre lied to and when was my last Twitter X post like everything just seems like it's hanging on by a Sho string and some duct tape um and that's just the start this thing then becomes chronic it builds up day after day and you're like okay we got to do this thing we got to do this thing another Weekly Newsletter and all these things start building on each other and you're like when did I last do my taxes and it it's just a horrible feeling and all that though is still okay it gets worse because then you start to lose sleep

###### 20

you lose sleep energy levels are worse now we're more anxious all the time I'm I'm you know anxious during the day caffeine's not helping with the anxiety or the impulsivity so now with a lack of sleep my impulse control is just so diminished that at the first sign of difficulty and the real effort that I want to do what do I do I probably actually go on YouTube and I start watching other videos right right I just consume something lightweight and that just makes the problem worse because all these things I wanted to do they're still there I'm just doing this thing that felt easy in the moment so you can see that there are

###### 21

these vicious spirals that kind of layer on top of each other until and this is the worst part you wake up and you're like I don't want to do anything like I don't want to go on that Zoom meeting I don't want to do this and and that it's like how you know it's it's great to be a Creator and U be able to share your ideas and have people resonate with what you have to say but on the flip side it leads to burnout more often than not in fact if you are a Creator at some point you will face burnout then the question becomes what are you going to do about it and so as a team we've been straddling this burnout for the past couple of years and now what are we going to do about it we've been talking about sustainability for over the for the better part of a year at this point what are we going to do about it well we fell into some of the same traps I freed up some time for 2024 in the middle of the year but then I filled it 2 weeks

###### 22

later with a brand new workshop a month-long Workshop so I fell into the same trap the same idea that oh I have to do more I have to like create this new thing instead we're thinking how can we recalibrate from burnout what is something sustainable not just now but how can we age gracefully um as creators as people who are sharing services and products for others what does that look like we don't have all the answers but how can we make something that looks more sustainable so yeah uh burnout it's a tricky thing there are a lot of sides to it and there are a lot of techniques and we'll try to link to maybe a few techniques in the description below that can help if you're experiencing some type of burnout but the takeaway that I just want want to leave you with is that doing more for the sake of more isn't the answer doing with intention is going to get you closer to something that is sustainable so notice it's doing pause with intention you have to have a pause so if you want to overcome burnout make space for space so

###### 23

if if I've been doing so much of this wrong if I've been doing so much wrong with YouTube how am I going to make this right what can you expect from me moving forward on this channel like what can we deliver for you I want to show up without having an agenda in mind like we do have services and products I want to show up though and just talk about what I'm excited about when it comes to learning and um being a better human being having better relationships maturing into adulthood um growing up in the world understanding what matters what brings us meaning how we can seek out and pursue more meaning and how we can live a fulfilling life that's what I want this channel to be about and grow into yes it's still going to be about notes and not making they'll still be plenty of videos on obsidian but it's all going to be integrated it's going to be a holistic view hopefully on Journeys into living meaningful lives that's what I want this to be about I want these videos to be a little bit vulnerable you know share these things

###### 24

that I'm like oof you know what if my extended family members watch this how are they going to react like I want to feel a little scared I want to to just you know be myself with you and and share these things because once we go deeper into notes and note making and we we think about the intellectual and how that merges with the body or the mind or the spirit we cover some interesting territory and that can open up almost like wounds into vulnerable places and uh and I want to just be more vulnerable so whatever that form that takes I want to be able to share those things I want to be able to share stuff on Yi and psychology every now and then I find that fascinating I want to share stuff on the body's fascia and how that connective tissue system is so similar to the uh connective tissue system of a forest which is the mycelium from from fungus like all this stuff is so amazing and then the connective system with our notes what is that well it's the link the link connects all this stuff so it's a

###### 25

holistic integrated view that I'm hoping to to share with you in a in its vulnerable way and at the end of the day if you watch a linking your thinking video you should be feeling internally I'm curious and this makes me feel more connected than before if you watch a video and you're like I feel more Curious I feel more connected then I've done the right thing I've done right by you I've Done Right by myself and so that's what you can expect from me moving forward and on this channel this is going to be a place that hopefully cultivates curiosity and cultivates connection and if you want to be a part of that well I hope you do like this video and I hope to see you in more because after 4 years of doing YouTube wrong I think I'm a little bit closer to figuring out how to do it right and I hope you'll join me for that ride so if you've come this far I would love to hear from you what made you stick around you know what resonated if you feel up to it uh let me know in

###### 26

the comments below I'd really appreciate that I think we're all dealing with different forms of this in this age of being on 24/7 so uh if we can share what's working or what's resonating that's definitely going to be helpful so hopefully I hear more from you in the comments and until next time stay connected
