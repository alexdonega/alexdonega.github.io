###### 1

when did you last read an article or talk to a friend or listen to someone and something resonated something really sparked what did you do did you just keep listening and say to yourself I'll just remember this for later but then you couldn't or did you have a way to capture the Sparks like lightning in a bottle today I want to show you three fun and easy ways that are at your fingertips to capture your ideas now I'll be using the digital tool obsidian but you can easily follow along in any app where you can just type words these three techniques are low Tech but don't let low Tech fool you they are great for getting ideas out of your head and onto the page sound good all right let's go by the way I'm Nick Milo and this is linking your thinking where we talk about the how and why of making meaningful notes and if you end up liking this video consider subscribing to the channel okay for this to work something has to spark now for me something sparked in a major way a long time ago and that's when I was

###### 2

reading a book this book is called flow it's by Mii chicks and Mii and what's so cool about it is it's talking about this concept we'll dig into the concept later but the point is something sparked within me something resonated and I wanted to capture that spark so what did I do well let's jump over to a place that we can type out text anywhere go anywhere you can but we just need to get what's in the head onto the page and we're going to do it with our first technique okay so now we're in my not making tool of choice obsidian and I I just created a new note and it's titled a new note I put my cursor in the body of the note and I'm going to do Freel lining what is Freel lining it is so simple it's unbelievable I'm going to hit a dash and a space and now I have a DOT it's just a bullet a DOT on the page and before we start capturing whatever is in my head and getting it onto the page I want to share with you a little bit of a poem

###### 3

scrolling down it all starts with a DOT to write down a thought which leads to a jot or two then there's no telling what you can do that's the power of Freel lining and what you see in front of you is a simple example of that so free lining is about Freedom it's about not getting caught up with formatting or anything initially you just have a place a line where you can write whatever so in this case flow new line flow is cool new line flow is optimal experience I'm capturing this so it's not stuck here it will fade if it's just here I'm capturing this so I can work with it all right so for this one there is a good quote that I do want to capture it's from the preface the very first almost I think the the first sentence even and so I'm going to type this out and make sure it ends up in a new line so flow is okay now we have another free line and this is a quote directly from the book now I want to zoom out and say something this video is is about

###### 4

the major pain point we have getting something out of here onto there this is about capturing lightning in a bottle it's not about obsessing over the bottle's label making a source note saying who the author is having all the highlights there perfectly organized no the spark will fade and we'll lose what made us come alive about the idea in the first place so number one priority is we capture this thing and we put it into our own words and we do that through Freel lining a easy flow of ideas dot by dot Bullet by Bullet block by block so next up after this quote I'm thinking to myself and it's always nice to have a couple prompts so I'm actually going to open up a sidebar and I have some prompts in front of me so that's interesting because so flow is interesting because flow is important to me because flow resonates because flow reminds me of something so these are just general prompts that we use in everyday conversation and we're going to bring it into how we capture ideas this is called notem making so now over here I'm going to say okay

###### 5

so I've just captured a personal memory and I'm reminded of how awesome it is to be in the zone to to be in flow so now I'm thinking to myself this Spurs the next line and I'm just Freel lining as we go I'm thinking to myself how can I get more of this feeling so I'm going to write how can I create more flow in my life and that's a great question and then I'm like well wait a second you you actually can't create flow you can create the conditions of flow but if you try too hard to create flow it I guess it's like cying water it's like trying to cut more water by squeezing harder it's all just going to escape through your fingertips same thing with flow and so now because I'm Freel lining I know immediately to say well actually you can't create more flow so I'm going to indent in line very freely and just type that out okay so how cool is that I ran across a cool concept and instead of just listening or reading and having that awesome idea just get pushed out of my memory I'm

###### 6

just taking a moment I'm stopping and I'm Freel lining out the idea why I like it what I remember about it in my own life why it resonates and now I'm actually thinking about how can I create the conditions of flow in my life so I can experience it more often how powerful is that get the ideas out of your head and onto the page this is technique number one free lining the second super easy technique to get the ideas out of your head and onto the page it's called free talking this just where we're talking to a device how easy is that but there are a couple pointers a couple tricks that make this come alive because sure we've been able to do voice dictations voice memos to ourselves for a while and more recently now they can be transcribed for us using AI great right well not great because if you just Ramble On for 15 minutes you've just given yourself a homework assignment and if it's not fun it's not going to get done so we're going to make it fun how do we do that free talking and the way we

###### 7

do it is by taking the same Concepts as we saw in free lining but applying them to how we talk so we're going to talk in blocks all right so back in the note here let me just give this first area a title and we'll call this Freel lining and then right beneath it we're going to have free talking and I'm going to jump into free talking and I'm going to on my desktop start a new line now the cool part about all this is that it's been happening as I've been talking instantly on my phone now if I'm stuck my ideas they just I just what's getting in the way of me getting the stuff onto the page well if it doesn't work with free lining if you don't feel like that you're tired or if you just need to leave your desk and move around so let's use our device free talking so this is how it works and you can see that there's a bullet already and all I'm going to do is hit the record button the dictate button and now I can start talking about flow I can move around

###### 8

I can get up and yeah I can just say whatever I want to but here's the real key here's the real key I want you to to really get comfortable with when you get to the end of a chunk of thought what we're going to do is simple I'm going to hit the return button and start a new line so this is where free lining becomes free talking but we talk in blocks we talk in chunks so we know that each chunk is something that we look forward to coming back to and we know where that chunk is in position to the other chunks that we've talked about and why this is so amazing is because free talking allows you to embody your thoughts I can get up I can move around I can think in different ways I can think over here I can think over there I can walk around the room I can do all of these things and all the while the thoughts are showing up right here but when I get to the end of a thought what do I do I don't ramble on for another 14 minutes and

###### 9

then lose the Nuggets of gold and those Sparks of insight no I hit new line and I'm going to get out all the great thoughts I'm having around the concept of flow so let's start talking so flow is great because it reminds me of playing sports and really coming alive where I was fully present in the activity and why I appreciated that so much was because because in most of life I'm thinking about different things I remember in high school there's always some High School drama or something and I remember being fascinated that when I stepped out onto the football field I could just be present and then 2 hours later all of my worries would return I'd be like wo I didn't even think about you worries all the worries out there I didn't even think about you for those 2 hours and so that was a moment where I was like I want to figure out what's going on on here I want to be able to live in more flow I need more flow in my life I didn't think about it in those terms but that's what I was after okay

###### 10

and then when I'm done free talking and I can do this anywhere at any time just having a device like this and walking around and you can see I'm continuing to talk and is continuing to record all the thoughts are there in my thinking tool of choice and nicely separated into different blocks of thought different chunks of thought that actually make me want to jump back in and pull out those golden nuggets of insights that I might may have just articulated unexpectedly and now it's on the page it's out of my head and on the page okay so at this point we've done free lining and we've done free talking and you can see the differences free talking you get out a lot of words and that's not always a good thing but that's why we are talking in blocks and with these blocks we can start to freeline here and we can indent as needed and say that these blocks are related but then here's where I start talking about flow so now I'm going to make sure that these are blocks about flow but now I'm talking again about free talking so it's

###### 11

going to indent back out so already I have a little bit of structure and how much better is that than massive walls of dictated text that you don't want to go back into and that's the problem with typical dictation even with modern AI doing the transcribing when you slow it down just enough to free talk and blocks it really comes alive but now let's get to the third simple and easy techniques to get ideas onto the page not free lining not free talking but free writing this is one of our favorite activities in linking your thinking free writing so to do this properly you have to keep your hands on the keyboard and just type you are not allowed to edit you are not allowed to really stop for more than a few seconds the goal is that you are giving yourself 100% permission not only that it's a rule that you have to keep typing type type type because if you're typing what you can't be doing is censoring yourself so flow Flo I know this concept's awesome free writing are we ready 3 2 1 okay I have some new thoughts that I've

###### 12

never thought of before through the process of freewriting about flow I'm not just verbatim typing what was in the book near the end here I start asking all these questions that kind of just bubbled out of me like when is flow a bad thing are video games a form of flow and if so how do we separate good flow from bad flow and does the pursuit of flow get in the way of nurturing our most cherished relationships with others or rather how can we maybe change that Dynamic and make flow a part of and actually Aid having good relationships with others I have not thought of this before and it's just come up because of a free writing exercise how powerful is that and you have this lowte solution at your fingertips at any time in almost any tool where you can just type text this is wild you don't need bells and whistles you don't need anything fancy you can do this right now nothing's standing in your way you can do free writing and if free writing is not working you can do free talking and if free talking is not working you

###### 13

can do free lining and what's really cool is you can actually mix and match these three techniques at any given time side note if you're kind of curious on the prompts that you see on the right part of the screen these are just some of many not making prompts that we cover in the linking or thinking Workshop link is in the description below and also later you'll see a link to notem making Mastery which is a whole self-paced course all about note making really excited for that one so if you can tell the real magic of all these techniques is how easy you can flow from one to the other so if you're at your desk and you feel stuck go ahead and get up and just start free talking about whatever comes to mind but then once you start to feel that free talking is just sort of like spinning your ideas in circles and not going anywhere then come back over here and just work with a few words or concepts and see where it takes you the strength of the outline is how lean it is and how quickly you can move

###### 14

ideas above or below each other idea IND Dent or outdent and rapidly make sense of the ideas that you're working with but even the best outlines can sometimes feel like we have to make too many decisions about how to structure things above or below or in or out so in that case we're going to check our self- sensor at the door and start freew writing and in that freedom of expression non-stop writing you will be surprised and sometimes really proud of what you come up with during that session and when you feel that start to diminish well guess what you can go back to free talking or free lining and all of this is keeping you in believe it or not a state of flow allowing you to get your ideas onto the page but wait there's more I want to show you one more method it's not immediately about capturing your ideas onto the page for that free line free talk free write but then how do you start linking your thinking how do you start growing your ideas in a fun and sustainable way super simple so that's what we're going to cover

###### 15

in the bonus section so the bonus method is simply going back through what you've already worked on and thinking about which of these words or ideas or insights can actually be their own note because they're so strong and powerful of an idea so as I'm going through the Freel lining section um for one flow that should be its own note maybe I could retitle this note flow already a note on Flow so how about I just say this is um another a special note on Flow so we can retitle we can rename something playing the rename game we can start linking our thinking with flow how about this the conditions of flow wouldn't it be nice to know what those conditions are wouldn't it be nice to just take what's in this book and capture it in its own special note that we can always link to well I've already done that so here I have the three major conditions of FL these are reminders for myself I can only create the conditions of flow and then hope that I fall into it so we've already started linking our thinking from the free lining section

###### 16

and then we can go into free writing and so I said I really like Mahal's coinage of the concept now that's the author Mii chent miay I read that incorrectly but um I know I already have a note on him so I'm just going to go ahead and Link My thinking so now I know this special note on Flow it links to Mii chent Mii it links to the concept of flow look here's another one where I can start linking my thinking and that's with the concept of woo way so let me start typing out woo way and there it is it's already an existing note in my particular note system my idea verse what

###### 17

about Alan Watts that's something else he's a person a concept that I probably want to link other ideas to and that's how we start supercharging our thinking our creativity and making the most out of our ideas that's how we start linking our thinking and if you really want to make the most out of your ideas and you don't want to do it alone consider joining the linking your thinking Workshop all the details are in the link in the description below it is the Premier Workshop in the world for creating a custom knowledge system based on linked digital notes and based on what thousands of students have said from around the world who have attended the light Workshop it will help you create a knowledge system that will lead to your best work and it will last you a lifetime so here's what you need to do next try out these methods today and you'll notice immediately the one that you most need and when you do double down on that method and let me know how it goes in the comments below when you get stuck with that method then the next methods will come

###### 18

in handy so whichever order that is I am fascinated to understand what it is for you let us know share your EXP experiences with each other and I look forward to reading them and replying to them in the comments below I really believe that the simplest of tricks to think more clearly and be more creative it's literally at our fingertips and just with a few simple practices we can get there we can feel it and we can feel like we are best selves more often but if you feel when you jump into a tool like obsidian you're overly distracted then definitely check out this video on the best ways to eliminate distractions in obsidian so can take advantage of these awesome methods I'll see you over here now stay connected
