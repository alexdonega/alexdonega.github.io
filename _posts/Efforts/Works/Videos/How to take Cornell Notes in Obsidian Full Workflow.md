Cornell notes are a time-tested way to learn better and recall more but can we use them in the digital age well now the answer is yes in this video I'll show you how to take Cornell notes in obsidian the free and future-proof note-taking tool that has empowered the world to think maybe just a little bit better let's go so what are Cornell notes first they weren't always called Cornell notes in the 1950s Walter Pock initially devised a handful of note-taking formats there was the 251 the 2332 and then the one that would eventually be naturally selected as the best the 262 format or what we now know as Cornell knows now it's hard to know for certain but I think it took around 30 years from the 50s or the 1960s for the 262 format to become the Cornell notes ideas they take time to evolve this is always just so fascinating so what exactly are Cornell notes it looks like this so what you do is you draw a capital letter I that's slightly offset on a page notes go on the right cues on the left and summary at the bottom so as

###### 2

you're taking notes listening to a lecture or whatever it is you write them in the big note space and you make questions and keywords as cues in the left you go back to the notes you add diagrams whatever and then make sure to summarize at the end and so that is the Cornell notes method now can you guess why this method is so powerful why since the 1950s it is still around today can you guess well the answer is because it's not just note taking it's note making and you can see my video here for the difference but basically Cornell notes require you to lean forward you have to be active not passive you you can't just take lecture notes you can't just be rote learning or learning verbatim you need to make living notes with questions with connections with summary and that's when learning becomes fun and what is fun is what gets done so now let's hop into obsidian and I'll show you how you can use Cornell notes in the digital age to understand in this case a part of a book so I was recently on a plane flight across the

###### 3

Atlantic Ocean and I had a lot of time now instead of sleeping I decided to work a book that's where you build rapid context before and alongside actually reading the book and now this helps you massively improve how much you learn and how much you remember from what you read so I want to show you the book in question and I have it here it is the language game by Morton H Christensen and Nick chater or chatter and uh it's a pretty wild book it's how improvisation created language and changed the world so that spoke to me I purchased it on the trip and I'm working it I'm thumbing through it I'm getting a lay of the land I'm creating mental Landscapes mini maps and the chapter I choose to start reading is not number one so it's actually chapter five here and we're going to put this under the microscope and I want to show you how I was taking notes while I was on the plane flight because this is going to impact the Cornell notes that we take digitally in obsidian in just a moment okay before we put this book under

###### 4

the microscope I just want to say this you might be wondering whoa why did you start with chapter five and that's because non-fiction books are for thinking not reading you know finishing a book means nothing and it's actually a harmful goal it like it doesn't matter if you've read 100 books in the last year hey great great that's you've done something good with your time it could have gone to a bunch of other things but at the end of the day what matters is what the book got you to think so let's reset our understanding of what a non-fiction book is a book is a tool for Thought okay so with that out of the way let's just check out these notes real fast okay so you'll notice I've written some words I've bracketed things I see other words in the margins underlines more brackets Star notes circles numbered notes writings in the margin you'll see some blank pages with no markings these are mini mental maps for myself and then at the end just make sure that you write a summary as well so we're done looking at the book and now we'll take

###### 5

it back over here because let's get into the notes and actually see how this plays out okay we're finally in obsidian and what you'll see here is that for the book The Language game I finally created a note and in this note you'll see that it has a few book details these are all collapsed call outs just some stuff that I like to track it doesn't mean you have to track it you have permission not to put in all the metadata possible around a book like this this book is for you and what you need so you know you may have heard of just in time when it comes to like metadata and knowledge think just enough what do you need that's just enough okay because you can go crazy you could rewrite the book in your notes don't do that you'd need what is just enough so in this case I threw in just enough and um you know there's this thing called work a book if you want to know more you can read more about the description below there's some other prompts there that I ask myself as I'm going into a

###### 6

book if I if I'm going to spend time on something like this I want to make sure I'm getting something out of it right like fiction is one thing and I love fiction but if it's non-fiction there's usually a purpose around why I'm reading it for some sort of outcome and so the prompts from how to work a book can help with that but let's go ahead and recognize that we have a generated note section and I made a different note dedicated just to chapter five and so that title was language Evolution without biological evolution and so something you should know now with Cornell notes is we can do these in obsidian now thanks to TFT hacker online who created the functionality to allow this to happen we're about to get into how you can get this functionality into your version of obsidian for now though I just want to show you how we're going through um Cornell notes you'll notice that there is a summary call out at the top and what's cool is it shows right here and it's forcing me to summarize the stuff I just read but just by having a

###### 7

summary on your page so what's so great about this is when you recognize why note taking fails us it's because we just over highlight we over consume we don't do anything with it and we feel good we feel those highlights told us something you saw how many underlines I had in here hey it feels great it's doing something else and I'll explain what that is when we Mark a book like that but for now what's important is when you're here you have an environment that is forcing you not just to be a consumer or an over highlighter but to be a thinker to be an engager I like to think of the analogy of like we're wrestling with information with ideas with knowledge in front of us and the beauty of Cornell notes is it has sections that force you into this it's an environmental space where you can't just consume because there's this space called cues and there's this space called summary and you can't just leave them empty so in the digital format what you have is a summary section and you can put your summary bits here if I go to render

###### 8

the page and I'll talk about this in a second it's going to jump up to the top so in the next section with details I'll cover that a bit more there are a few notes I have here about page notes and not to overdo it and kind of a method that I prefer that my page notes are taken I try to do a one-liner at the top with the page number in a little bit more detail if needed below it's a really clean it's a simple way to make page notes so you'll see here for learning purposes I numbered all the pages of the chapter because I want you to notice and remember we we flip through every single page how many of those notes from the book did I not bring into the note making space in obsidian here into my ideaverse the majority did not make it in so why did I make them in the first place well there's still value of them being in the book it's just I'm showing you all the page numbers so you can see I haven't done what wasn't fun and what wasn't fun was copying

###### 9

over all my markings like why hey I believe in landmarks they help us navigate and half of my markings are cognitive landmarks they give texture to the landscape of the ideas on the page it turns a wall of text into a makeshift map now this may seem like a small thing but this is a massive permission you should not copy over everything I mean it's absurd really and I would prefer right now that you add this to your permission list you don't have to copy over everything add that to a permission list and it's great to keep a permission list if you don't have one in your notes I highly recommend it you can see

###### 10

on screen here uh permission list and here you go so this is currently what I have I have some stuff in other spots but that's the the core list that we go over when as it pertains to Knowledge Management in the ideaverse so you should not copy over everything from your book markings so we can go ahead and close that one for now so all you need are the ideas you want to have repeat in your mind what are the ideas that you want to have repeat in your mind another way is like what's really sparking right and I love that idea of ideas repeating in your mind and so let's see how we're doing that with these page notes so on page 133 uh Charles Darwin's cousin and brother-in-law Hensley Wedgewood was one of the founding members of the philological society dedicated to the study of language so what I did I'm going to go into Source mode here and it's going to look a little messy but you can see that I added this cue and then I wrote the queue philologist Hensley Wedgeworth influenced Darwin so that cue now when it's in

###### 11

the normal like kind of a live preview mode is going to render over here and if I go into the true reading mode and what's cool about this is It's printable then it's going to look like this so that's that cue that I made and so what you're doing essentially is when you're ready to write a cue you can just go ahead and if you have maybe a template you can just go ahead and say Q goes here I can start typing and then I click um uh into preview mode and we can see that the queue is here and kind of cool that way to take cues on the Fly that show up here now remember cues are not just questions but that's how you can best think of them like here I have a thing that I want to remember you can also have key terms that really pop up and down here we have a question can I articulate how to debunk the theories because in this book they really take down uh Stephen Pinker and chomsky's theories around how knowledge or how language came to be what else I'd like you

###### 12

to see really fast is that when you take these page notes you can you know even have some quotes built in here so this is a long quote kind of long and I'm doing my own italics and bold italics to really draw out things that matter to me gradual emergence overlapping linguistic patterns emanate I just love this language it's helping me really make sense of what I'm I'm reading it's really important and then I go ahead and above I do my one-liner Darwin's Focus was on the cultural evolution of language not a biological one that's a really important point of this chapter I mean it's in the title language Evolution without biological evolution what does

###### 13

that mean exactly and then to really understand what that means can you articulate how to debunk those other theories um and then here's uh some cool brain stuff there's a visual on page 158 I just want to make sure I can keep that in mind I mean later on I could even drop in that image take a screenshot throw it in but here's the question do I really need to have it in here now you're going to fall into the Trap where you're like I really I think I I mean if I want it to be complete it should be in here but you really just have to know and ask yourself just like is future me going to need this and how badly so I always prefer to err on the side of just enough as opposed to overdoing it if you overdo it you're going to stop doing what's fun what's fun is what gets done and if you do too much it stops becoming fun at the top very important very very important that you summarize this so these are my three points from this chapter there's nothing better when it comes

###### 14

to note making than putting it in your own words coming up with your own opinions your own observations so I say Darwin used the evolution of language to make the point about evolution the evolution of species so language to species how both are now governed we can think of them as being governed by natural selection and then you can throw in some observational opinions now the authors didn't attack Pinker and Chomsky that's me because it's sticky it's going to stick in my mind and I don't have to hold on to this idea strongly but because I wrote it out strongly it's going to help me remember it better this is just memory 101 you know the the flashy the spiky gets remembered a lot easier so in this one Pinker and Chomsky are incorrect egoists seizing on data soon prude false that the brain evolved in a thousand in a few thousand years to do language when that is inaccurate for a number of reasons and then the third one that relates to kind of like why did I even pick up this book in the first place my work on idea emergence is deeply

###### 15

related to the evolution of language and I need to spend further time here I need to have these ideas repeating in my own mind in my idea verse here because that's going to help me lead to some emergent ideas so there you have it now in the next section we're going to get into how you can get Cornell notes working in your obsidian vault all right now how can you get this set up in your obsidian Vault here's what you do first things first is you want to go to this URL provided by TFT hacker for the Cornell notes learning Vault you'll see it in the description below and this is where you can buy I think it's 19 let's just check this out real fast so there is a cost involved if you want this working in obsidian it's 19 and it's a lifetime of updates that you get from this fantastic individual in the global community of personal Knowledge Management and tools for thought and that is TFT hacker so if you're curious what TFT stands for and you haven't guessed it already it's tools for thought and so this is quite the

###### 16

service that TFT has provided for us and if you want to buy it which I currently I have it installed and everything what you're going to get is a learning vault what does that mean it's a bunch of files so at the end of the day you'll open up a learning Vault this is version two I gave it a kind of a funky title apologies for that but when you open it you'll be able to start here and learn the intricacies about how to get this going I mean there are a couple things to learn but it's really nicely laid out and what's cool is it's showing you how to use Cornell notes for not just note taking and not even just note making but actually as a navigational tool so you can get around with little callouts and informational bits so what I did after playing around in the learning vault is I through this folder the highest level folder which we're calling a vault into my ideaverse so if we go back over to my ideaverse here I can find that same note what was it was like uh zero zero start here

###### 17

and you can see that here we are and now we have that same updated version of the Cornell notes learning Vault so I Incorporated it here as well so your best bet to get started is simply to go to the URL that you'll find in the description download this learning Vault figure out how to install it properly and then you're off to the races if you find that you've made it that far then I have something more for you just some free templates to make it really easy to add cues and insert summaries into whatever note that you're in so the first thing you want to keep in mind is that you will need a CSS class it's just this little bit of yaml this little property that you add at the front of your notes don't worry about it right now but what that allows us then to do is well hey let's look at this and try it now so with the free template that you can download from me you can go ahead and hit the template button and then hit Q and then you'll get this queue and you just start

###### 18

tight you double click and whatever you want to type here so just start typing and then when you click away hopefully the magic happens I once I go into render mode so before I render it it's just going to show up here and then once I render it you'll see and here here's a little bit of the bugginess this is fresh off the press and the great news about purchasing a lifetime of updates is that you'll get the updates so right now we can kind of see that they're rammed together so for this to work properly I'd probably throw it down a little bit lower let's see if that did any different yes okay so now we see that it is my goal and then that's exactly in line with that is just start typing so that's something to keep in mind too you don't want to take too many cues and really it's a good forcing function because we shouldn't have more cues than we have notes then we're likely doing something a little backwards in the Cornell notes philosophy that is so that's how you would add a cue and then let's pretend

###### 19

what do we have here so that's a cue as well and then at the bottom well do we have a summary on this one I don't think we have a summary I think we could add one though what if we change this to a summary well no I don't want to do that let's go ahead and try to throw in a summary so now I have another template for you if you'd like where it just gives you the summary with the three bullet points then you can go in hit edit and just say this is good really good note taking and note making let's click away let's go ahead and render it boom there it is at the top so the key for making this work is to get rid of those two friction points inserting cues and inserting summaries and if I can help in any way I hope those free templates in the description below can help you and get you off to the races with Cornell notes all right so I hope you've gotten something out of this video maybe you've just heard of Cornell notes for the first time maybe for

###### 20

all these years you've been calling it The 262 format unlikely but whatever the case may be hopefully you can see that when it comes to learning better and recalling more we have to do more than just take notes word for word from whatever we hear or whatever we read we have to engage with the material so ask yourself how are you engaging with the stuff that you encounter and if you don't have a method for that you're missing out the Cornell note system is one way to do that because it gives you and it basically it forces you into this environment where you take notes but you also gotta make make something out of that you have to have cues that have questions and your comments and your concerns and then at the end you have to wrap it all up into a summary in your own words in your own observations and hopefully even your own opinions and that's when we transcend and go beyond passive note-taking into the active note making with all the benefits that the ideaverse of compounding value over time allow you for in the end that's how knowledge truly

###### 21

becomes power this is one way to get there I wish you the best of luck let me know what works for you in the comments below and until next time stay connected foreign [Music]
