###### 1

there's two questions I I really like to think about one of them is what would I do if I knew I couldn't fail but the other one is what would I do even if I knew I would fail which is really nice because that's the thing that you would do the thing anyway so I I just love collecting these sorts of journaling prompts that help us figure out what to do with our lives cuz then we can reflect on them and think how aligned am I with that you also talked about burnout you know people always been throwing around the word burnout quite a lot and like broadly the phenomenon of burnout is where often it presents either as a sense that the work you doing is meaningless or it presents as a sense of like emotional fatigue there's this this principle that sounds like it comes from a German sociology teacher called the what it the wrof the wrof principal the wrof principal tell us about this yeah so are those glasses prescription welcome to how I think I'm your host Nick Milo it's easy to read what people write and see what people

###### 2

share but I want to explore how they think how the sausage gets made yes we'll cover the creative process but I also want to find out their unique perspective see how it was formed what influenced them and how it's evolved over time my guest today is Ali abdal he's a doctor turned YouTuber soon to be turned best-selling author of the brand new book Feelgood productivity he's also become a friend over this year and I'm thrilled to learn more about his journey to becoming the world's most followed productivity expert are you ready let's begin happy to have you here thanks for having me this is going to be so much fun yeah this is I was just relaying this is the fifth time that we've met this year the fifth time yeah oh [ __ ] yeah it couple times London Denver and ohigh yeah so it's wild I'm just really grateful for that and uh I think YouTube just seems to be such a big thing I I want to start a conversation around there now Bas this is based on something you wrote in your book in your chapter chapter five find courage you

###### 3

write that you wanted to start a YouTube channel in 2010 but you didn't film your first YouTube video until 2017 M what took so long so in 2010 well ever since 2008 since I was in school I always liked the idea of being a YouTuber and I watched a lot of YouTubers who do musical covers of popular songs so people like Kurt Schneider Sam Tui Boyce Avenue there was these like OG YouTubers and they would pick a song like I don't know Firework by Katy Perry or something it's Firework by Katy Perry who knows like a song like Firework by Katy Perry and they would like arrange it and like play the piano and someone would be singing along and it'd be like a con and like a guitar and it would be sick um and I thought that would be cool I'd love to be a YouTuber who does stuff like that and so every year from about 2010 onwards every summer in the holidays I'd be like yeah this is you know this is the Summer where I'm going to make my first YouTube video and then I'd get started stuck in overthinking

###### 4

I'd get stuck in thinking I needed the perfect gear I didn't have any money at the time I was totally broke so I'd be like oh maybe I could buy like one of these childish microphones but like I need a good microphone otherwise I can't can't do it and like all of this stuff and there s years later in 2017 when I was in my fifth year of medical school that was when I actually started making videos for the first time and my first five or six videos were musical singing covers where I was playing the guitar and accompanying some friends and even for those there was a lot of like imposter syndrome to get over a lot of perfectionism and like no one cared like those videos got like three views back in the day got like a few thousand now because people look at my back catalog and they see what the hell is going on here but I had so much like kind of emotions and stuff blocking me from doing this YouTube thing I'm so glad I managed to get over it eventually because otherwise we wouldn't be sitting here yeah

###### 5

that's amazing and so even your first first few videos they weren't just you they were with your friends and these musical things so wow like whatever it takes you finally got over that hump um that's really interesting don't you think that the the seeds were planted like 7 years earlier and they were kind of I don't know germinating in this way yeah I think that's that's a good way of putting it I think like the seeds of starting a YouTube channel were planted I think also the seeds of Entrepreneurship like in around when I was around 13 so this would have been like 200 S or something like that yeah um I started learning web design and web development and tried to build my first internet businesses this idea of like making money on the internet was like a thing in my in my in my area and I'd get home from school and I'd be like so excited to hop on this website called getac coder.com and like do some web design and like make a few dollars here and there and alongside I was also teaching a lot of uh kind of maths

###### 6

and English stuff when I was younger so I'd be tutoring younger students and I had a part-time job working for this math study center and really like it was those three things this sort of desire to be a YouTuber plus desire to make make money on the internet plus background in web design plus the fact that I was teaching for a long time that ultimately culminated in the YouTube channel s years later which was where I was teaching people to get into medical school and had a decent production value and thumbnails and stuff cuz I knew how to do web design so all of it sort ofate connecting the dots looking back starts to make a lot of sense but obviously at the time I was just sort of throwing [ __ ] at the walls and trying to figure out what would stick and just trying to do do what felt enjoyable in the moment that is wild to see how your all these random skill sets coess into something really spectacular also in your book you you talked about your little brother and the Protege effect how basically teaching him but it sounds

###### 7

like you taught a lot of different people that's really fascinating because you're young at I mean you're saying you're 13 or like I was helping people who were like seven eight at the time then as I got older you know when I was 16 I started doing private tutoring for kids who were like 14 to 16 when I was 18 I was helping kids who were 16 when I was in medical school I was helping younger medical students and so like every year of my life I've tried to I I just realized I really enjoyed teaching and I I didn't quite realize this until like 15 years later when I was trying to figure out what to do with my life and I asked myself like you know what are the moments that have been the most meaningful what would I want written on my gravestone and I landed on some combination of good father good husband and good teacher or inspirational teacher and that was when I realized ah wait [ __ ] I've been teaching every year since like 13 and that that was so meaningful and I love this [ __ ]

###### 8

so like that is the thing that I want to do with my life yeah there are so many quotes around different ways to learn better by teaching you include one in your book by senica and I can't remember it exactly yeah it's like a Greek quote or something uh qu dolit something so those those who those who teach learn something to that effect yeah I mean in what that four words yeah something like that to Encompass so much of of kind of what work has seemed to work so well for you in life and not just for you but for everyone that you've influenced that's culminating not not at the end but just as another Milestone that amazing book and looks beautiful thank you yeah quick one while we're still on YouTube and pull this back there for just a little bit out of all these videos that you made now this is something I've I've recognized recently the ones I love the most don't always play well is there a particular video that you just think oh I really love that one it's like it's like a Hidden Gem even if it doesn't have

###### 9

the view count there was one video I made where I you know there was a trend on YouTube where this guy called Dr Mike would react to Medical TV shows and he was absolutely blowing up and he was like really good-looking doctor and he would react to like gry's anatomy and explain the medical side of it so I was like okay that's a cool concept why don't I explain the science behind Harry Potter and so I have a video where I painstakingly did a bunch of research to figure out what are the elements from Harry Potter and the philosopher stone that have some kind of science behind them like if petrificus totalis were um a drug what drug would it be it would be something that caused muscle paralysis and stuff you know when Snape at the start talks about uh diany and aconite and Azor Stone and stuff in his potions class uh what are these herbs and turns out they're all things with medical properties so I made a whole took bloody ages to make this video I Illustrated animations and diagrams and stuff and no one cared it completely flopped but man

###### 10

it was fun and it was an experiment and I think like looking back on this now a lot of being a successful YouTuber especially for longer than a few years is about experimenting experimenting your way to success and there are so many series I've tried on the channel that I've tried and and that have flopped and then some of them work out and then you're like okay cool that one worked and you double down on the things that worked yeah a few years ago I realized I needed more series of of content and so I thought huh I enjoy reading books what if I made a video where I just a series called book club where I just make videos about books and what if you know if this becomes big then one day I'd be able to interview authors talking about their books and then they'd want to come on my channel because I make good videos about books and so now I've made like loads of videos about books and that Series has done really well and I know from the grape vine that authors like Morgan howel have been saying to their

###### 11

friends that hey that video that Ali abdal made for the psychology of money really did you know did good things for our book sales alongside that I've had like dozens of series that I've I've started and tried that have not failed but that sorry that have not worked including this like science explained where I was like welcome back to a new series called like medic science explained and in in each video in the series I'm going to do XYZ I just made one video in the series The Harry Potter one and it didn't work I like okay that's fine so I think I'm all about you know having an experimental mindset an experimental approach to stuff and and that's clear in the book too because each chapter has six experiments in it and after I got through because there are three parts as well so after I got through the first part that's 18 three chapters 18 experiment a lot it's almost too much oh well you know I felt full yeah and I was like I mean is that it I mean I felt like that's the end of the book and then when

###### 12

I was looking at the page count I thought whoo there's a lot of meat per minute here so I was like okay let's go let's find out about these per minute I like meat per minute uh the the issue with meat per minute is that so Malcolm Gladwell has an analogy around um books are made up of meat and candy and meat is the stuff that like is the the value of the book but candy is the stuff that people will talk about and you have to have if you want to be a a well selling author you have to have a good balance of candy as well and so a big challenge with the book was trying to make moments where people are like oh you know that that one thing that you said about that thing is the thing I really liked and often I found when I give talks about this stuff that the simplest things are the ones that people talk about um so yeah yeah to that point I I think that's such a balance and there there'll always be the critics that say oh too many stories I just

###### 13

want the facts but I noticed that that excellent balance in here where the stories were never feeling overbearing or that they went on for too long long they they were there they were compelling they made a point and then that led to an experiment or some takeaway or a personal story which I really loved just hearing all the different personal stories that you had like the fact that you are a magician yeah who I mean where' that come from oh so some would say that came from uh an inferiority complex when I was in school and the only thing that I had attached to my identity was the guy who got good grades I wanted to be cooler than that and so when I was around 16 17 I watched uh pen and tell fool us where magicians would come into to pen and tell and they would try and fool them and stuff there was this magician called Michael Vincent who came on with this [ __ ] amazing card trick where he would do some stuff with the cards and at the end he was like spieling a bit and he was shuffling

###### 14

the cards and things like that and he was it was a very nice nice motivational message and then after doing all his shuffling he spread the cards out and they were all in order and it was just like a new deck order like Ace through to King for of each of the four suits and my mind was just blown wow in a like absolute mental way and I thought wow I want to be able to do card tricks and so I started learning how to be a magician um bought a bunch of books pirated a bunch of DVDs bought a bunch of magic supplies and I would have a deck of cards with me when I was in school and I would show people card tricks and the uh the kind of popular kids would then like be like oh my God I show us a car trick and I so I started getting all this validation which I hadn't really had previously um and maybe connecting the dots looking back maybe that's where the desire for validation came from the addiction to like o likes and like success and stuff on YouTube wanting to

###### 15

be seen as someone more than just the guy who got good grades I think that's where the magician thing came from and I kept on with it for several years I'm trying to audition for the magic circle now which is a prestigious organization in the UK and you have to like do a 12 minute act so I'm working with one my friends to make a 12-minute act oh right right now you are well like you know on and off for the last couple years yeah it'll it'll happen at some point in the next few years so the tricks are still alive trick are still alive yeah I've got a few sponge balls in my little Tech bag where I do some tricks before we complete move away from YouTube I'm sure we'll always Circle back to that but you did talk about the book club series and what are a couple of the like from that series books that you've talked about I'm kind of curious which ones really stood out to you like one that stood out to me from your reviews was 4,000 weeks by Oliver burkeman I'm just kind of curious if

###### 16

you had a favorite there's um so many that you've reviewed is there any that come to your mind yeah I mean the the book that had the most the biggest impact on my life was the 4-Hour Work Week by Tim Ferris um uh second place would be show your work by Austin Clon show your work was actually the book that helped me get over the fear of putting myself out there so in 2016 I read that book and that was the book that helped me start my own personal website cuz before reading that book I was thinking I you I've been thinking for a while I want to start a blog like that seems cool I was reading like I think I might have been reading Mark Manson's blog as well back in the day but I I would I would read these blogs and I think oh it' be cool to start a blog and I bought the domain ali.com and for years I just sat on it because I was like oh it's it's too weird to have a blog like I can't I can't be the guy who has their blog a

###### 17

Blog called Ali ABD dal.com that's weird that's too arrogant that's too audacious and reading show your work by Austin clayon helped me realize that actually in the modern world you can't just do do stuff and expect people to find it you have to be findable and in terms of posting stuff online it's totally okay to show your work you know if that if showing that work could help someone who's a step behind on the path or could help people discover you or anything like that just teaching what you know and sharing what you're working on is a totally reasonable thing to do and Austin Cleon made a really great case with that in the book and so I was like cool January 2016 started a Blog and that was the precursor for the YouTube channel because I don't think I think if I hadn't started the blog I definitely wouldn't have had the confidence to start the YouTube channel it's a totally reasonable thing to do that is uh just something that needs to kind of be on repeat because there's just so much fear out there of of starting or any of this and

###### 18

to just recognize hey this is reasonable yeah like this is the reasonable thing to do you can do it it's like broadly no one cares when you do it so it's fine and so what's not reasonable then I don't know there's very little that's not reasonable I think um yeah honestly most things that people want to do they probably can I think there's a lot of fear in people's ey eyes there's okay I'm going to caveat here so like if someone is below the poverty line then it is very difficult for them to sort of just take take risks and like do stuff because you got to Fe feed the family like obviously let's cave at that put all of that aside I suspect there sorts of people listening to this podcast or listening to how I think and and following your stuff are not at that level where they have to worry about the basic the basic needs being met provided your basic needs are met there's almost nothing you can do that's like too audacious um I think you know I see I I see this a lot with people like wanting to

###### 19

I don't know quit their job and do something else it's like it feels like such a big deal because oh my job making me 50K and so if I do something else I'm down to zero it's like no you could always just get another a job maybe you'll get a 40K job so it's only a 10K risk and also 10K once you've got your basic needs met and as long again as long as you're not on the poverty line you probably all right but we put so much fear into like decisions like leaving the job or starting a YouTube channel or doing stuff like this and I used to be like this back in the day and so I'm trying to like whenever I I meet people who I feel like could do something that they really want to do but they're being held back by fear I'm I always try and be as encouraging as possible to be like hey man just like do the thing it's not it's not that deep no one cares you don't need to take yourself so seriously again provided you can feed yourself like you're actually good so

###### 20

you can take risks especially when you're young so on that point um and tying back to the book The Batman effect which I loved it's like oh it makes so much sense yeah and uh and so I guess question for you right now are those glasses prescription so these glasses are actually fake um the so I had laser eye surgery about 2 years ago and that cured my need to wear glasses but uh I still wear the glasses partly because there's like brand Association and stuff partly because this actually is a bit of a a privacy screen in that I tend not to post photos of me looking like this and so if I want privacy a bit more when I'm out with my girlfriend or my family or something I can take the glasses off but most importantly I think you know there's this thing called the Batman effect which which which which I talk about in the book which is from a study that some psychologists did on like kindergarteners and they asked them to like they they split them up into a bunch of different groups and they asked them to do

###### 21

some sort of like creative task or something and one of the groups was just told to do the task as normal and another one of the groups was told to like imagine themselves as like you know imagine themselves being more confident or something like that but the final group was told to imagine themselves as some sort of character like Dora the Explorer or Batman and they found when the results came in that the group of students who imagined themselves as being Batman or Dora the Explorer or whatever they did better in the task and they felt better about it and they were more creative and they were more like resilient and all the good things just by as a result of like putting yourself into the shoes of someone that you that you're not and they called this the Batman effect and a bunch of people have used this over the years so um Beyonce had an alter ego called Sasha Fierce that one of her albums was named after and this was the alter ego that she would use when on stage and also to sort of separate her from the media because she

###### 22

would feel as if she's this character not herself Adele used a similar trick and so when I read about this I realized that for me the putting on the glasses it's like I'm like the the person who I like to try and is Young Charles Xavier from the X-Men Series played by James makoy in the amazing film X-Men first Class um and I and in that sense I imagine myself as a teacher as just like oh I'm just a I'm just a dude who learns stuff and then who shares it with people and I'm sharing from the heart and I'm sincere about it and that is what putting on the glasses helps me helps me in body yeah it makes me immediately thank you for sharing that it makes me think like okay who's my alter ego and I don't know but just that like thought Journey that little jaunt is is so fun to go on like and I don't know what it is I'll get back to you when I figure out a couple but I'm like yeah this going to be a lot of fun have you got any ideas on the

###### 23

short list like who could it be if you had to if you had gun to your head and you had to like so a few names when Return of the King came out Lord of the Rings I went dressed up with some friends for the midnight premiere of course and uh I was dressed up as Aragorn of course but everyone's like oh froto like aor this is the big sword not the small one but um I don't know I I think the the characters from there I think really kind of like speak to me and how they can straddle I don't know both the masculine and kind of like the softer you know they don't have to present to feel confident in who they are and how they show love so there's something there there yeah I don't know these days who's on the short list but I think maybe I think Aragorn might still be on the short list there nice yeah nice it's a good old where you go yeah I'll think about it some more nice okay um couple other books okay so not on nothing that you've done with the book

###### 24

club I'm just kind of curious because your audience obviously loves books my audience loves books what's another Hidden Gem that is a book that you've read that you haven't widely talked about or at least you haven't recorded a video on that really spoke to you that's a good question so in the world of business there's a book called The e- Myth Revisited by Michael Gerber and that is like a looks like a boring Business book but it's actually really good uh and it's all about about delegation and that book helped me realize as I was building my business that I needed to hire people I needed to delegate and help me figure out some of

###### 25

the um some of the ways that I could go wrong along that path so I I I I just love absolutely love that book um but another one that I've been rereading recently is the Power of Now by eart to which lots of people are familiar with because it's a huge bestell but I read I read it a few years ago and it didn't quite Vibe with me but I recently reread it about a week ago um when staying with some friends in Colorado and it really started to Vibe with me the idea of focusing on the present moment and just the the truth that the present moment is all we have that has been a really empowering and freeing thought for me over the last few weeks and the present moment is all we have you know at the moment at the time that we're recording this there was tons and tons of bad [ __ ] happening in the world like we're in the midst of the Gaza War um every day on my social media fees and in the new in the news I'm sort of glued to what's going on and

###### 26

there's just so much suffering in the world but that book kind of helps me realize that despite the fact that there's all the suffering in the world fundamentally all we can do is ourselves is to live in the present moment and so when I remember that while I'm having a shower or while I'm walking or while I'm I'm playing a video game or doing a podcast or doing a video or whatever the thing might be it's like oh the present moment is all there is and so let's try and enjoy it let's not take it so seriously let's appro approach it with lightess and joy and yeah just been trying to trying to to live in that mode a little bit more that's really nice The Power of Now honestly I've never read it because it felt it was one of those things that some of the best truths are the most obvious and therefore they're neglected and uh I'm definitely going to to open that one up now it's very good yeah I love it but what about note taking so a lot of your videos and a lot of what you've shared on

###### 27

YouTube are strategies around learning or taking notes and how has that evolved for you in the past let's say six years six seven years I feel like this is a constant search for the Holy Grail that I'm never going to find so you like literally as of yesterday I started experimenting with tana and reflect cuz I was like hey I've got some time now I finished my book I want to I want to write more books great that's a good chance to reviv my PKM system I was actually rewatching your course as well oh funny um I think I I sort of i' I've been taking notes in obsidian on your course as I was going through so I resumed some of those I have yet to find a system that I can actually stick to um I would love some help some help in this regard because to me there is this Holy Grail of notetaking which is that oh you know just as you read stuff just as you're going about your life you'll capture all these notes and you make all these connections and then at some point you'll just like effortlessly

###### 28

produce a book and I'm like okay like what it seems pretty effortful so like what's where's this where's this magic where's this magic bullet of note taking um yeah what's what am I doing wrong you're not doing anything wrong like that's that's the thing there there just Different Strokes for everyone um what's magical is just I think with links the moment that you make a spontaneous connection and and and feel that and like oh whoa because of the tool it forced me to make that connection like it's an environment so in your book you mentioned senius the term by briano yeah and um love for you to talk about that um but that's what I feel like in environments like obsidian is that it's actually this environment I'm not surrounded by people I'm surrounded by these Amazing Ideas and I'm just among them and they're talking to each other I'm like oh wait you two and then in between who's missing oh new idea that I haven't played with yet and then like spark article video great conversation I want to share that's kind of um the magic that starts to happen okay that sounds

###### 29

very inspiring okay I'm inspired again I'll give it another go tomorrow morning um okay well well on senors just a second because there is something I really need to hit on here and that is this quote by by somebody in April obsidian is my main personal note-taking choice for personal Knowledge Management I was a bit surprised when you said this in a YouTube video is this still the case or are you just constantly checking out new things yeah I think obsidian is the one that I've stuck to most but I am still checking out new things partly the reason I'm checking out new things is somewhat commercial in that I like theide idea of being able to acquire a small minority stake in like a note taking app CU I promote the [ __ ] out of a lot of note taking apps and like I would like to own a percentage of the one that I promote and so I've been trying to figure out like I don't think obsidian is that because of the whole open source Community nature of the project it seems not to be a for-profit initiative as such um

###### 30

but so I've been exploring with some of the exploring some of the new ones just to see like is there something that I can just put my weight behind and actually start using it and if I love it then I can reach out to the the founders and be like hey man can I invest in that that sort of thing so that's been in the back of my mind yeah you did that with oh I'm not sure if it's worth if I can mention score app yeah so after you mentioned it um in a previous previous session that we were hanging out um I I got into that and I love score app score app is great yeah yeah it's an amazing app yeah I think this is kind of where a lot of the Creator economy is heading where you know yes making online courses is great but like that there's a cap to how much money you can make through online courses but creators with distribution acquiring Equity stakes in Tech startups that potentially trying to go big that doesn't seem particularly capped and so that's an interesting area that I'm trying to

###### 31

dabble in without taking it too seriously because fundamentally the thing that I care about is teaching not investing yeah but it's a good way to round out that portfolio so hey I actually want to go back to something else that I read in your book that I think I want to dig into some of the Inspirations around your life and the one that I thought was pretty interesting was under an experiment called schedule your breaks and you relate a story about Dr Adcock Chris what a legend yeah yeah so you know the final the final part of the book is about how to sustain productivity and actually I was recording the audio book for it like last month and as I was reading the final three chapters I was like oh my God like I need to take my own advice cuz I think I'd been on the verge of and sort of be on the point of burnout quite a lot and I had really noticed it until I was reading these things being like burnout it's definers but I was like oh okay [ __ ] I need to do this um so

###### 32

there was there was a time a few years ago I was working in the emergency department and it was my first day on on the job um and I was just sort of emergency departments are always are always busy um but this was just in the aftermath of covid and um you know there was loads of loads of patients coming in it was my first day I wanted to make a good impression and so I was working I I think my my shift started at 8:00 a.m. and it it got to like 1: p.m. and I was just kind of working away and it was time for lunch but I was like nah I'm going to power through it's all good and Dr adock one of the Consultants um so we call them Consultants you call them attendings he was like the the the physician in charge of the department he came up to me and he was like Hey Olie have you taken your break yet and I was like oh no I'm good it's fine you know I'll just I'll just carry on I'll grab some food afterwards and he kind of reached

###### 33

across and he turned my computer screen off it would have been antisocial to power the Entire Computer off cuz I had notes that were unsaved but he you just turned the screen off and I was like what's going on and he was like look I think he basically said like no one is going to die because you take a break like there is always time to take a break and he said he kind of basically explained that in emergency medicine there is like this hard and F rule that you cannot go more than four hours without taking a break for at least half an hour because they've done all the studies on this and they found that doctors who don't take breaks end up killing people and that is not a good thing to do and end up burning themselves out as well which is also not a good thing to do cuz then we lose doctor from the system so a lot of the job of the physician in charge of the emergency department is not to see patients it's to manage the morale And the emotions of the doctors that are working under

###### 34

them and to encourage them to take breaks every 4 hours and so he basically forced me to take a lunch break and I that you know that that moment always has always stuck with me I should remember it more often because I could definitely take that advice more often but I think like yeah scheduling breaks making sure you have time to take a break no one's going to die it's probably fine yeah no one's going to die in the entertainment industry we say it's not heart surgery oh we're flying around through all these different things and it's like what are we you know we don't have to be stressed out of our minds yeah even during heart surgery even during heart surgery they take breaks so like um if it's if it's open heart surgery you often they'll connect the heart uh they'll connect the circulation system up to a pump and so the heart will stop beating for a bit so they they're able to operate on it and they'll like cool it down and the system is like you know this machine is taking the blood out of the patient's body and then

###### 35

like warming it and clean clean it and filtering it and stuff and then putting it back in once it's warm they're fairly chill because you can actually keep a patient under that for like hours and hours and hours so sometimes they'll be like all right you know we're going to take a quick break 10 minutes sergeon will grab a cup of tea he'll sort of chill around play some music and they'll come back to it and that's also totally fine because you can't maintain concentration for such a long period of time because these are bloody all day events these heart open heart surgeries wow so they take breaks halfway through they you know they sometimes take a break for lunch that sort of thing when you say it it makes sense yeah but you know just kind of envisioning it it's like okay yeah let's have lunch yeah might as well oh that's that's pretty wild before we get back to other Dr Adcock in your life maybe from earlier on those type of um random Role Models or people who give you a lesson that you don't expect before we get there uh you

also talked about burnout and so this is in part three of your book and uh sustain right and that's when I was really leaning forward I love the first two parts just where I'm at personally what I've experienced over the past couple of years working from home doing all this online stuff it's burnout and your chapter on burnout you're having a conversation with your mom and uh but you may you also come to the realization that there are three types of burnout and I was just glued reading those pages yeah so you know people always have been throwing around the word burnout quite a lot um and like broadly the phenomenon of burnout is where like it's it's it sometimes present presents different differently for guys and girls there's like a bit of a a gender a gender sort of thing here often it presents either as a sense that the work you are doing is meaningless or it presents a sense of like uh emotional fatigue and so generally when people are approaching the verge of burnout like for me it's this s the sense that my work is meaningless I'll start thinking oh

###### 37

what's the point I'm doing a podcast what was the point of that anyway it's like what Nick Milo [ __ ] sake like you know I start having those sorts of thoughts and you know most often it comes to YouTube videos being like oh God that video what was the point six side hustle ideas what am I just a slave to the algorithm and all this kind of thing and when I start thinking those sorts of things I'm usually like okay that's a good chance that's a good sign that like maybe I should take a break take a step back reconnect with why I'm doing this thing but after doing a bunch of research into burnout um I kind of distilled it down into three different types um was this you distilling it yeah I really like those distillations oh nice I'm glad it was it was a team effort me and the editor and like our research assistant being like hey we get all these things around burnout like how do we cuz you know three three part structure is always nice we like there's got to be a three- part structure here cuz

###### 38

we we we could see like these different different threads and we pull them into these three things um so essentially there's overexertion burnout there's depletion burnout and there's misalignment burnout so overe exertion burnout is what it says on the 10 it's where you're just working too hard basically depletion burnout is where you work for a long time without taking breaks so this tends to be kind of without taking a vacation without taking a holiday and then misalignment burn out is like I think the most interesting one because that's where you might be doing something that you enjoy and you might be making money and like climbing the ladder but the thing that you are doing is out of alignment with what personally fills you with joy and lights you up and energizes you and stuff and that's the one that I see so often among successful people because you can be very successful but if you're doing something that feels even a little misaligned to what you actually want to be doing with your life that is a huge recipe for Burnout and from the outside it's like you know you've got it all you're

###### 39

a successful corporate lawyer like what are you talking about like you've got work life balance as well is what's what's happening um I I found this when I was when I went full-time on YouTube for the first time I'd taken a break from full-time medicine I was like what right do I have to feel burned out like what um but misalignment burnout strikes when the things that we are doing in the here and now are not aligned to the Future that we actually want for ourselves and that involves trying to figure out what that future actually is which is which is hard and recognizing when we are Dev ating too far away from our I don't like using this words it sounds kind of woo but it's it's so true like we all have this core sense of this thing that lights us up and this thing this this thing that we enjoy doing and that's different for for every one of us and a big challenge of life and careers and stuff is figuring out what is that thing for you and how can you how can you find a way to explore and

###### 40

express it yeah that that really resonates and the first two are like okay yep yep and then that last one is this like ooh that hits hard the misalignment yeah and kind of thinking through that but that's what the whole book is helping for is what I recognized is oh the whole book's about like the hidden thing is from my perspective it's alignment understanding who you are through these experiments with these chapters like okay I can try that and that's going to help me get to that alignment um I felt really empowered oh thank you I appreciate it and like in in just in terms of like a practical thing that that that people can try on that front a really good experiment that I I really Vibe with is the Odyssey plan um which is basically the it's a it's an exercise designed by these professors at Stanford Business School who are specialists in like product design and they've written a book called design your life or designing your life which is about how to apply the principles of product design to a life well- lived and this thing called The Odyssey plan is

###### 41

basically you imagine yourself 3 to 5 years from now if you continue down your current path what does your life look like then you rewind you're like cool that's fine then you imagine yourself 3 to 5 years from now if you had to take a completely different path cool and you write out what that's like and then you imagine yourself 3 to 5 years from now if you had to take a different path but you don't need to worry about money and you don't need to worry about what other people think of you and what does that life look like and the idea behind doing the Odyssey plan is that like often when we're thinking about what to do with our lives we think very uh like the thing that I'm doing is the thing that I will will be I will always be doing and we tend to be fixated on this this vision of the world that we know but if you force yourself to take a step back and even for a few minutes just like sit in silence and think about it what would life look like if you had to

###### 42

take a completely different path if you're not allowed to do the career that you're currently doing what would you be doing for me if I wasn't allowed to be a Creator I'd probably do some sort of tech startup but if I wasn't allowed to be a Creator and wasn't allowed to do a tech startup and money and social status were No Object what would I do I would probably maybe write books anonymously which sort of overlaps with the Creator thing but it's like even even now just thinking about it in other ways even I think about this stuff all the time but I I always learn something new about myself and it's doing exercises like that that helps us get some of the way towards figuring out what do we actually want and then making and then figuring out a way to make sure that our our actions in the here and now are actually aligned with that future yeah yeah not so you don't want to be a magician I would love to have a one-man State show so a sort of cross between Darren Brown meets Jetty kind of motivational magic music mentalism

###### 43

guitar throwing the guitar a little bit as well you know if someone's like part of part of building a stage is that you want to uh manage the moments for the audience when someone is coming on stage so for example if you're calling a volunteer up you suddenly have this moment of dead time where the audience is like waiting for something to happen and so or if for example you're doing a trick and the the participant on stage has to do something like shuffle cards here or there or while they're sh they're shuffling you have to keep the audience entertained and so having a guitar to just be able to there are a few magicians I know who like strum ukulele while that's happening it's just kind of fun it's like they they add some Vibes while other things are happening so yeah maybe some guitar okay well if we have to think the Odyssey plan for that happening in some alternative future I'm I'm game for that if the the other thing on that front it's like this is not in the book uh it it wasn't there but we cut it out because

###### 44

we only had so much space there's there's two questions I I really like to think about one of them is what would I do if I knew I couldn't fail but the other one is what would I do even if I knew I had even if I knew I would fail I've not heard that one which is really nice yeah because that's the thing what would I do even if I knew I would fail that's the thing that you would do the thing anyway and so for me actually I realized what would I do if I knew I couldn't fail oh I'd build the ultimate productivity app I'd build the next notion or whatever the thing might be but would I do that if I knew it would fail no absolutely not why would I try and build an app if I knew it fail but even if I knew it would fail I would still want to build my own magic show because the process of doing it would be so enjoyable so I'm like oh that's interesting even if I knew it would fail commcial commercially I'd probably still want to write another

###### 45

book because the process of writing it would help me help me think help me learn and it's quite satisfying things like that so I I just love collecting these sorts of journaling prompts that help us figure out what to do with our lives because then we can reflect on them and and think how aligned am I with that youd have to be 100% aligned but if as long as you know you're moving in a particular direction like moving towards the direction of our Northstar tends to Stave off misalignment burnout and tends to feel really good as well yeah that is an A+ prompt I mean the twist there too cuz we I think most of us have heard the first part yeah but not the second one so as we get into sustain in that final part everything that we're talking about burnout especially and there's this this this principle that sounds like it comes from a German sociology teacher or Professor called the was it the wrof the wrof principal the wrof principle tell us about this yeah so yeah those uh I think this was when my first year of working full-time as

###### 46

a doctor you know i' I'd get home from work in the evenings and then I'd edit a YouTube video and normally I found a way to make editing the YouTube video feel good and feel energizing and enjoyable cuz that was my whole productivity hack if you can find a way to make the thing feel good make it more fun play some music in the background Put The Hobbit soundtrack as my soundtrack for the video or whatever the thing is find a way to do transitions find a way to do anything I could to make the process of editing this video a bit more fun most of the time that worked and most of the time I'd get home from work and I'd feel excited to edit a video which is how I was able to turn up content on my YouTube channel but some days I would just flop on the couch and I wouldn't have the energy to edit the video and i' feel and then I'd start beating myself up I'd start feeling guilty I'd start being like Oh but like you know consistency and the Channel's doing well and I don't want

###### 47

to [ __ ] things up and like oh my God occasionally my housemate who was also a doctor would see me doing this and one time she said Ali why don't you just write the rest of the evening off why don't you why don't you write it off and I was like huh it's a good phrase why don't I write it off and I needed I need needed to make an an issue of my email newsletter that day cuz I've been writing a weekly email newsletter for like 5 years now I was like write it off why I write it off I was like why don't call it the write off principle and initially it was spelled WR as in w r t e off but I was like it's kind of more fun if I just pretended some German sociologist tot spelled re e i t f the right-of principle it seems more legit right it seems It's like yeah the something method the Batman effect I personally love naming things for my own sake but I sent this newsletter out and got loads of replies from people being like Oh my God this

###### 48

this principle is really helpful and I didn't tell them it was I I sort of pretended it was some German sociology guy I just sort of thought i' I'd have a bit of fun with it and so many people loved the write-off method and I had to include it in the book part is a bit of fun um but now like like for example this evening is a write-off evening for me cuz I realized that you know one thing I haven't done in a while is play video games and so after this recording I might pop over to the razor Store buy myself a gaming laptop that I've been salivating over for years and play some balers Gate 3 and that's gon to be my right off evening and it's things like things like that like I think some people would be like basically what you're saying is have an evening off it's like yes that is exactly what I'm saying but for productivity Bros for people who get to chapter eight of a productivity book usually those people are fairly highly strong fairly typ a personalities fairly like achievement oriented and sometimes I just

###### 49

find it really helpful to be like yeah this is a thing this is a write off day why not yeah I love that so much and when I saw that term I was reading pretty fast uh and then I was like wait a second oh oh yeah okay yeah I didn't quite explicitly mention that it was a sort of a joke in the book but like some people pick it up and you've kept that the whole time from that first newsletter because I was like okay so where did this principal come from I'm researching it seems like it came from Ali but the way that you write about it it was you don't go out like this is a term I've coined you kind of like just sneak it in there thought funny it was it was initially a joke but it's stuck so I just go with it now cool yeah all right couple I want to kind of dig into some influences or you know parts that are maybe lesser known maybe dig back just a little bit before the YouTube phase um and go back to a question is who are the

###### 50

Dr Adcock from earlier in your life so before yeah medical school before Cambridge there was another another moment from Dr adock himself which was when I was I think it was in my fourth year of medical school and that's when around the time people started asking you what specialty do you want to go into what Residency program do you want to go into and I was I was never sure I was never sure of the answer I was always like oh but like there's so much like I don't know there's like 50 to choose from and I need all the sampling and stuff and I happened to be talking to Dr Adcock over like coffee one time and he was like look man just pick something and go for it and he he said something that he said it's much easier to steer a moving ship than a stationary ship and I was like oh [ __ ] he's so right so I just decided I was going to go for plastic surgery just went for it and in the process of going for plastic surgery I unlocked lots of opportunities I started working with

###### 51

this Co charity I met met a bunch of people and eventually I realized I didn't want to do the thing but like the process of going towards that specialty meant that I had all this momentum so when I switched to anes anesthesiology anesthetics and then later to Obstetrics and Gynecology and sort of had a bit of float around I had this momentum built up and I I still think that think about that a lot and often say this to my team when it comes to making decisions about things to do in life it's so easy to get caught up in analysis paralysis and yet if you if you do just pick something and just start to work towards it the the way will reveal itself over time so that's another classic Dr arook one that I I I always go back to um other influences so actually this is this is less wellknown um when I was in the seventh grade we call it so when I was like 11 there was a friend of mine who was a bit of a bad influence and he's still a friend to this day his name is

###### 52

James and one time he and I were sitting next to each other in class and he had this like weird credit card that he signed up for at the age of 11 so he would have lied about his age a parent address and he he told me that look if you spend money on this credit card you can like you can like make a few pounds here and there online you can you can you can make some money on the internet he was like why don't you give it why don't you give it a go I was like make money on the internet that sounds interesting yeah I could give it a go but but I said to him no but hang on I need I need I need to ask my mom for for for permission cuz you know I was a good boy and he was like dude [ __ ] your mom why would you ask your mom for for for permission just like do the thing and I was like oh [ __ ] you're right and he probably doesn't know it but that comment from James set me on on

###### 53

on the entrepreneurial path cuz my mom is like you know she's she's a parent super risk verse back in the day like putting your credit card details on the internet was like oh my God what the hell are you doing all of this kind of stuff if I'd said hey Mom can I livee about my agent sign up for this like Dody affiliate marketing money-making scheme on the internet the answer would have been hell no but I didn't ask permission I just went for it and over time I learned to code I started building websites I started building trying to build businesses trying to make money and all of that sprouted into what this YouTube channel is and what the book now is and why we're here and it all sort of stemmed from this idea that you don't need to ask permission and I think you know in my context I was 11 so I was like my mom was was the permission holder but I also think like we are all waiting for permission from someone to do something we don't need that and we don't need that permission um yeah so I

###### 54

think about this a lot like who am I waiting for permission to do something from and then often I realize huh I think actually I'm waiting for someone to give me permission to take a break from uploads on the YouTube channel because I need someone to tell me it's okay to do that but actually why am I why do I need permission I me just do the thing permissions are so interesting I mean the write-off principle is just about giving yourself permission yeah and you have permission to you know sign up for a fake credit card it's like carrying a permission list is a kind of a cool thing oh tell me more permission list a permission list yeah so in in my notes app I have this ongoing permission list Y and it's just like you don't have to take a note on that nice yeah like anything like that though it's like you don't have to and it's just like yeah I don't and it's been one of the more liberating things and just I'll throw it up every now and then nice one of the things for me is you don't have

###### 55

to finish that workout nice yeah U I'm not sure if it really serves me over time but yeah well it does and that goes to to your book I can't remember the exact section but it just get started to do a little bit Yeah and then give yourself that permission not to do the other um like what was it you said you just do yeah if you just do five minutes you can always give yourself permission to to not do anymore usually more often than not we'll find that if we do something for 5 minutes we end up just wanting to continue doing it because the inertia has kicked in but sometimes if you do

###### 56

it for 5 minutes and you're like actually I'm not feeling it that's totally okay there's there's very little to be gained by forcing yourself to do a thing against your will I think this is why I don't like the whole narrative around discipline and like you got to be more disciplined and all this suffering and all that [ __ ] it's like okay fine but like most people are not David goggin most people cannot discipline themselves to to wake up at 3:00 in the morning every day and just go for a run for most people we do the things that we feel like doing and we don't do the things we don't feel like doing so instead of like complaining about disciplined that we're not disciplined enough let's just find a way to make us actually feel like doing the things that we want to do let's find a way to make it more fun let's find a way to make it feel good play music in the background do it with friends like that's what the first three chapters of the book are all about just how what are the strategies that we can

###### 57

use to make stuff a little bit more enjoyable I love those strategies people play play people power yeah play people power the three p we were thinking of adding a fourth which was progress because that's another big part of it but we incorporated that into power and then there was going to be a fifth purpose but then that's the Final Chapter so it's like really there's these five P three three to five PS depending on how you slice the slice the thing that really give anything more enjoyable uh make anything feel more enjoyable and I and I feel like the the biggest elephant in the room with that is these environmental factors going back to sen Senus um like DAV goggin incredible discipline but when I when I want to unpack that a bit more I love looking at at well what's the environmental factors like he's not surrounding himself with Cheetos in his bed you know at night like you know it's the environment that allows discipline yeah as we often think about it to to to look like that yeah absolutely and this is why I'm I'm a big advocate for like a

###### 58

pleasant environment to work in like if if the desk is tidy and the keyboard is like nice it makes you more more it just makes you it makes it just a more pleasant experience to sit down and do some work this is why I often take my laptop on the go with me like rarely at my desk because I like the idea of just going to a coffee shop and working from there you know I get out there whatever it's a bit it's a bit more enjoyable back when I was in medical school I would do library hopping so there were like loads of libraries around Cambridge so I'd just go to a different Library each day adds novelty adds a sense of adventure yeah and this is actually one of the one of the sort of practical tips in the book to make anything more fun just to ask yourself the question simply what would this look like if it were fun or at the start of the day the question I ask myself is what's today's adventure going to be and it sounds really it sounds too easy but like just framing any

###### 59

amount of work as an adventure or as fun completely changes the way our our brains think about the thing and genuinely does make the thing feel like more of an adventure what does an adventurous podcast look like what does an adventurous writing project look like how can I make this PowerPoint that I'm boring as PowerPoint I'm doing a little bit more fun can I add a funky animation can I put some background music in cuz why not it's like we're all so worried about being so serious and being like professional and [ __ ] that like we forget to have a little bit of fun and forget that people want people people love to be surrounded by other people who energize them yes and generally being professional is is the same as being boring and generally that's not the way you energize the people around you and also not the way you get ahead if that's what you care about yeah absolutely and that's why the book is called Feelgood productivity exactly like I I love that so much and and that idea is just seeped within every single chapter um World of Warcraft you

###### 60

mentioned that yeah and I loved reading that little sentence it's like when I enter World of Warcraft I'm not ell ABD yeah I'm sephos sephos blood elf level 80 blood elf warlock with billowing robes and yeah an army of demons at my command yeah it's play it's it's side quests it's Adventures yeah all of that stuff chapter one people can just honestly people can just read chapter one introduction in chapter one and then you'll get most of the book not true but that's an awesome part of it for sure I have a question for you why did you decide to start this podcast what's the motivation uh you've you've heard me mention it already so many times I'm obsessed with environment and I want to be around people who inspire me and I I want to be connected and have these conversations like we're having right now like that means so much to me I'm obsessed with that I actually I had this whole book um when I was in New York around 2014 it's all written but I never publish it it's called amateurs Quest oh that's a nice title I like it yeah

###### 61

um and that might be what the book that comes after linking your thinking but the the whole point was this this journey down willpower I thought a huge part of it was going to be about how to strengthen willpower SL discipline and it was this matusa doll and I was like okay so willpower is actually a smaller one and that's based on habits but above habits is in environment and it was it's like what's the biggest Matuska doll of them all and at least my conclusions at that time that was a decade ago was it was environment and if I want to change any type of behavior if I want to be more disciplined um it's all about who I'm around what the environment is so this the the impetus to do this this podcast is and is just mainly to be around inspiring people and and to get to curate that list you know like you can't meet with everyone I can't meet with everyone so who can I meet with that would just be amazing yeah it's good reason to do yeah yeah thanks for spinning the tables there uh have you done

###### 62

this before um okay so I love this question if researchers were observing you at ages let's say 8 to 18 or let's go 8 to 16 what would they have noticed anything unusual that's a good question so I think they would have noticed spending a lot of time on the computer um they may have noticed spending a lot of that time doing things that looked like wasting time um I was watching so many TV shows back in the day I was addicted to World of Warcraft for 3 years from age 14 to 17 where I'd be playing like 3 and a half hours a day but at the same time I managed to do all my school work and also I managed to try and do like build these web web design businesses and learn web design and development and stuff and one of the things that always puzzled me about my peers is that we would all have the same number of hours in the day in that we'd all get home from school around 400 p.m. and then we'd all sleep around like 10:00 so we would all have those 6 hours every

###### 63

day to do stuff and in that time I was playing three three and a half hours of World of Warcraft having dinner doing my homework watching TV shows and also doing web design and development and a lot of other people were complaining that they didn't have time once they did food and and homework to do anything else M and so I always found ways to squeeze more stuff into my time and but I think it's because the stuff felt so energizing and that is I guess the sort of message of the book like if you do the things that feel good or find a way to make whatever you're doing feel good it becomes more energizing and you have way more energy to give to to it and to other things so when I'd I'd come rushing from school to do a web design project I'd be like yeah then I'd make some progress on my myql queries or whatever I'd be like cool World of Warcraft for a bit and that was super energizing i' be like cool TV show to wind down and it was just like go go go and I guess

###### 64

now that I I'm a sort of somewhat self-professed productivity expert that's sort of what I do now as well I just teach people how to do that as well but in a way that's enjoyable sustain uh enjoyable sustainable and meaningful enjoyable sustainable and meaningful it's not the first time you said those three in a sometimes I put intention in there I haven't I haven't yet figured out like a pure repetition on this that's part of the Mantra behind like the the commander intent yeah okay which is featured in your book absolutely I so what was interesting about that is um it's one thing to have an intent intent from a commander but what I was like oh and I turned my head was when you tied it to your business and your team and how you communicate if there's a new idea does it match this intent command intent yeah I think that that just speaks to this idea you know for people who are not familiar commander's intent is this idea from from like the Austrian Army and like the 1800s where it's like you kind of when you're when you're commanding troops on

###### 65

the battlefield or doing any kind of military operation you want to explain the intent behind the like the why behind why you're doing the thing rather than just the thing to do and this was really shown up in D-Day in 1941 when was dday 1941 1945 2 maybe2 I don't know 1942 yeah inde uh when when the Allied Forces landed landed on the beach on the beaches of Normandy it was a total disaster like they landed in the wrong place the platoon that were meant to be with the right platoon weren't with the right platoon and every was a total [ __ ] up but because the commanders had communicated the intent behind the operation I.E C's strategic units and C C's strategic areas and bridges and stuff people knew why they were doing the thing and so they could improvise the how even though the plan didn't go according to plan MH and so I think that's where you know speaks to the we were talking about having like a bit of a vision for your life gives you that why like why do you want to do the thing it's like once you

###### 66

know why you want to do the thing and like the the intention behind it now you can figure out the how the how will take care of itself even if the how goes uh go goes off course wonderful one I'm just kind of curious about though you do talk about your mom a few times and your your grandma I'm just kind of curious uh what's something positive that you've taken from them or that you've seen yourself from them oo um my my mom is very generous she's a great host she's always Keen to have people around like feed people like always going out of a way to pick people from the airport and that kind of thing and I really admire that generosity of spirit um I think I've sort of I've sort of emed some of those traits in that like at University my room was always like an open Hub and people could just come and go as they play as they pleased and I would always have snacks in there and feed people and like always have the door open um and I found that sort of when my mom does it

###### 67

it was just just really nice cre a really welcoming atmosphere and you know that's part of what we talk about in the book around people like if you're even even if the goal is productivity which if for the record it doesn't have to be then creating crafting a welcoming atmosphere with the PE with people that you love around you is just so nice it just makes everything more pleasant and makes you more energized and makes your work feel feel more fun so I think I've really taken that generosity of spirit from my mom I love hearing that and what about your grandma my grandma actually she used to be an air hostess for the pist St International Airlines and then she decided to forget about that and trained as a teacher and my grandma did a lot of homeschooling for me and my brother when we were younger cuz we were living in southern Africa and for like one of the years the schools that we were in the area of were all too violent for us to want want to go to and so my grandma homeschooled us and so I think she instilled

###### 68

Within Me This Love of learning and also the love of teaching and that has served me very well over the over the years I love hearing that I love hearing those connections to family um yeah so as we wrap this thing up I guess my main question is what would you want to leave the audience with as far as a challenge to them something based on the book perhaps something of a dare that they could try out nice that's a really good question um I think okay here's a challenge when whenever you're listening to this the next thing you for the next thing you do ask yourself the question what would this look like if it were fun and just see what comes up what would this look like if it were fun especially if that thing is work rated if it's already fun then you know it's not much of a challenge but if you have to do a thing in the next 24 hours that you would ordinarily think H or it's boring or like work whatever ask yourself what would this look like if it were fun and do you leave a

###### 69

comment below and report back I love it what would this look like if it was fun okay well thank you Ally I've really really appreciated this thank you so much it's a pleasure being episode one of your new podcast oh to see how it goes all right thanks so much before we finish I just want to do a few socials so this is the book I've already pre-ordered the hard copy thank you Feelgood productivity by Ali abdall you can find him on almost all the socials at Ali abdall it seems absolutely but the most important thing to do right now I believe is to go to Feelgood productivity.com and think about making a pre-order it definitely helps him out and it helps spread this message I think it's a message worth spreading I think it can help you and who knows maybe some of the people around you and if you do pre-order I found this was interesting and you added this uh I don't know when exactly but um after I pre-ordered but don't worry I'm registered the feel-good productivity annual planning workshop yeah we I literally launched that like yesterday yeah we updated
