James clar's most famous quote from his book Atomic habits is that we don't rise to the level of our goals we fall to the level of our systems what if I told you he did not come up with that quote out of thin air in this video we'll track down exactly where that quote came from what it means for our own creativity and we'll even practice some of this quote remixing ourselves you ready let's go so Tim Ferris was interviewed by Business Insider in December 2017 and in it he mentions one of his favorite quotes that gu a lot of his actions and it's from this ancient Greek poet arilus and arilus says we don't rise to the level of our expectations we fall to the level of our training that sounds familiar doesn't it 10 months after that interview interestingly enough is when James clear's book Atomic habits comes out with his quote we don't rise to the level of our goals we fall to the level of our systems so similar quote but slightly different did James Clear plagiarize arilus no he did not he remixed the phrasing of arilus but put it

through his own thoughts and experiences his own expressions and he came up with something that was different and unique and impactful that is a microcosm of what we do when we remix something we can take quotes and remix them through our own unique worldview and perspective and what comes out on the other side is going to be original and I want you to fully Embrace Your Role to remix words that have existed before phrases and quotes that have existed before feelings and experiences take them pull them through you filter them through you and what will come out on the other side will be you an original work okay let's practice it's pretty simple really when you find a quote you like you're going to keep the form but remix the flavor to do that I'm going to share my favorite personalized thinking space which is Obsidian so when I open this up what we're going to do is go through each famous quote one at a time and then try to remix it I encourage you to pause the video and add your own remix in the comments below or if you want to watch

###### 3

the whole thing then after we go through all three please share your own remixes in the comments that's how we make something like this really come alive so if you're ready let's hop in and now we're looking at my idea verse my thinking space and it's in the app called obsidian what we're going to do now is close the right hand sidebar so we have a little bit more clean space I'll even close the leftand sidebar and we're going to look at quote number one no man steps in the same river twice and this is by heraclitus okay so what's going on here we can deconstruct it we can unwrite it we can do all sorts of things but intuitively how could we remix this no man steps in the same river twice I have a couple for you already so here's remix number one coming up no Chef Cooks the same dish twice okay so what just happened there instead of no man we go no chef and now now we're not talking about stepping around we're talking about cooking and we're not talking about a river we're talking about a dish do you

###### 4

see how this is working all right ready for a remix too we can take this same quote the same form that we have okay and we're just adding different flavor like the chef did in that last example Le so now in Remix 2 no artist ever Paints the same canvas twice do you see how this is working so I encourage you now to pause the video and come up with your own remix write it in the comments and then when you're ready let's jump to quote two okay on to quote two the unexamined life is not worth living by Socrates the unexamined life is not worth living all right how would we remix that what's going on here what are the elements that we can remix let's look at remix number one the unorganized closet is not worth opening that's a funny one how about this the untasted cuisine is not worth cooking not not as good but hey we're on a short timetable here so your goal now is to think how would I re remix this the unexamined blank is not worth blank the UN blank de blank is not worth blank that's

###### 5

really what you want to get to so with your remix try to write that in the comments below when you're ready we're going going to jump into quote number three the journey of 1,000 miles begins with a single step and that's by ly so remix number one the writing of a thousand Pages begins with a single word oo I like that one I really like the second one too you ready for it here we go the growth of a thousand trees begins with a Single Seed oo that's a good one now I encourage you how would you remix this again think what's going on and a lot of this because language is not new to us is intuitive so we'll immediately understand instead of Journey we can flip it to writing or growth like you see in the examples instead of a thousand miles we can do a th Pages or 1 thousand trees and then instead of a single step we can do a single word or Single Seed so you start to just intuitively pick up on these patterns and then you can be a remixing pro and again it is original if

###### 6

you take a form and filter it through your own experiences to add your own flavor that's where the originality comes from not from sitting next to a rock for 40 days until Brilliance strikes you like a bolt of lightning it takes from taking the existing stuff in the world the existing forms and ideas but then remixing them through you the stuff that makes you unique and then sharing that those flavors with other people now if remixing quotes isn't coming naturally to you that's what this lesson in the online course writing original Works can help with with but I just want to show you what's actually in here so if we go to practice remixing ideas into new ideas this is going to break apart and deconstruct the remixing process so if we try this one from the ancient Greek poet arilus we have the original we don't rise to the level of our expectations we fall to the level of our training so the first thing that you want to do in this case if you really want to deconstruct the process is do an Unwritten version where you just try to speak plainly about

###### 7

what is being said don't Adorn it with fancy language or any sort of interesting form or structure just try to speak as plainly as possible so here's an example our training is the Baseline of our outcomes not our goals or dreams so that's me trying to say it as cleanly as possible now the other thing you can do is make the editable version so if anyone's familiar with Mad Libs we're doing something similar we don't rise the level of our noun so we're replacing expectations with noun and then fall to the level of our noun so we're replacing training with noun with this editable version all you need to do now is think about how you want to replace the two nouns now if this is coming to you intuitively you won't have to break it apart and deconstruct it this way you can just jump right to trying to remix it and then we see the popular remix below you do not rise to the level of your goals you fall to the level of your systems by James CLA so now what is your version if you haven't already with this quote the

###### 8

quote that we've been spending the most time on in this video hit pause and try to remix this for yourself we don't rise the level of our noun we fall to the level of our noun I dare you to pause the video and share your remix in the comments below make this come alive for you that's the best way to do it okay let's wrap this thing up I'm going to assume that you've already shared your versions of different remixes in the comments and I just want to share a couple takeaways also from the lesson in the wow curriculum okay let me make this even bigger takeaway number one it's easy and fun to remix ideas all you have to do is just add your unique perspective it's like you're adding flavor to a dish that's all you have to do and takeway number two it's necessary to remix ideas it's selfish not to add your voice to this conversation that we're all having it is selfish to keep it bottled inside keep that in mind that's the more selfish move here it's not selfish to share your voice so I really want to encourage

###### 9

you to lean forward and share and communicate take what's already out there those great Tim tested forms and formats and structures but then filter it and flavor it through your own unique perspective so on the other side you're sharing what is truly uniquely you an original idea and work flavored by who you are and final reveal on screen your next action is to be more like James CLE and remix quotes like AR kisses if you can do that I believe your creativity will be on the right track and if you want to learn more about writing and writing effectively with linked notes and writing original stuff then I encourage you to check out our course writing original works the link is in the description below I hope this video has given you a sense of permission to be more creative there's nothing that should be getting in your way between what you're thinking and what you're sharing you have permission and until next time stay connected now if you got something out of this video on how to energize our minds and remix existing ideas then you definitely have to check out this video on
