"Cornell notes are a time-tested way to learn better and recall more. But can we use them in the digital age? Well, now the answer is yes. So, what are Cornell notes? They weren't always called 'Cornell notes.' In the 1950s, Walter Pauch initially devised a handful of note-taking formats: there was the 251, the 2332, and then the one that would eventually be naturally selected as the best - the 262 format, or what we now know as 'Cornell notes.' Now, it's hard to know for certain, but I think it took around 30 years, from the 50s or the 1960s, for the 262 format to become 'Cornell notes.' Ideas take time to evolve; this is always just so fascinating."
