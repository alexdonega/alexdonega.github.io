you need to have time to zoom out we get so fixated on our patterns that we get into and our world becomes so small and narrow if you don't have dedicated time to zoom out you're going to get stuck in these patterns that keep on repeating and typically whatever was there like whatever opportunity it's not going to stay the same size it actually might start getting smaller over time because you're just kind of in the same rut you're just kind of spinning your wheels in the same rut instead what you need to do is zoom out like you need to have time to go on a personal Retreat and do a life audit and get this like zoom out on your life go to a different space and that is going to lead to so many more aha moments and deeper calm and understanding than simply doing the same stuff that's leading to burnout
