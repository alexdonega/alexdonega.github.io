###### 1

in this video we're going to go over simple tips and techniques that I use to eliminate distractions and stay focused while I'm using the app obsidian these are six or so super simple things that you can do at any time that you're feeling a little overwhelmed by any screen or device you open up obsidian and what I'm going to show you will always work for you you ready all right let's go okay let's hop into obsidian so what you're looking at here is the default obsidian theme and I have a bunch of notes open so I might be over overwhelmed from being on the internet I might be overwhelmed when I jump into here because

###### 2

there are a lot of open Notes so the first thing that I'm going to do the number one most simple thing you can do and don't overlook this is to just move up here and click the create new note button now we have a new note we have somewhere clean to start and kind of just reset for a moment the reason this is effective is because sometimes we just need a calm space a reset where we can now reorient and figure figure out what it is we want to do and how simple is that you can do that at any time and that actually leads us right into the second simple tip that you can do so the first thing that I'm going to do in this note is to give it a title and I just want the title to be the general idea of what I'm trying to do in this case I'm going to type figure out what I want to do it's that simple just title your note with what you want to be doing at the top of the note and you might be thinking wow create a new note

###### 3

how spectacular and now you're telling me to title the note wo this is groundbreaking but the world is a crazy place and sometimes we just need to know that we can do a couple grounding rituals to get our mind right so we're not so scattered but we have a little bit more intention and calm in whatever we do next now if you're like me you might get hung up every now and then trying to find the perfect title but this is where linked notes allow you not to worry about this you can title this thing with whatever and if I don't like the title figure out what I want to do or just as often it suddenly becomes more clear as I start typing in the note so for example I'm going to change this one figure out what I want to do to what I'm actually doing right now which is prep and film an awesome video see how much more clarity so this process is iterative and it can always change what you want to do so I click away now the file name has a new title so let's go even further

###### 4

and pretend that I've done some typing and some thinking about what I want to accomplish so I'm just throwing in some placeholder text just so we can see how that might look on screen now as I'm doing this though I might notice I'm still feeling too distracted I'm noticing that there are some interesting notes over here I haven't touched in a while and the sidebar if I start clicking on some other tabs like this now I have all sorts of things that I might want to go into these are rabbit holes that are great but they're not great right now so the next simple technique that you always always can do is simply close these sidebars so if you go to the left- hand sidebar hit collapse there we go to the right hand sidebar we hit collapse here now we have even fewer distractions and front and center is what we want to focus on and that's the only thing that we have to worry about however you may have noticed I still have a bunch of other tabs open and if you're like me these tabs can be open loops and every now

###### 5

and then you just see them as this new distraction and you want to click on it to see where it might lead so I might click on maps and say o where can I go from here or I might click on my Concepts note and think about the cool Concepts that I've identified as being meaningful in my Knowledge Management efforts and then all of a sudden I'm thinking what was I doing again so in this case if you click on the note you want to focus on then there's actually a command to close all other tabs immediately except your current tab so to do this we're going to hit the most popular and the most important hotkey in obsidian which is command p on a Mac or contrl p on Windows and we're going to start typing close and that will give us a few options and what we want to select is close all other tabs so when I click this all those other tabs will disappear and boom even fewer distractions now how beautiful is this looking now and that takes us to the next thing you can do to eliminate distractions because

###### 6

usually you might not have obsidian full screen on your device device so maybe your internet browser is bleeding through the left hand side showing you all these potential portals or gateways into more rabbit holes of distraction so that's where if you're not already full screen you can either manually Make It Go full screen or you can click the expand button to make sure that obsidian takes up the full screen so that's the next simple tactic that you can do to eliminate distractions and right on the heels of that one the next thing that you can do to improve your focus in obsidian is to play with the size of the text so on a Mac I can hit command plus and minus to change the size and this is where I want to go really big because this is the only thing that matters right now I'm just going to zoom in as much as I can which is the setting that we're currently on I'm in Max zoom and now I can really focus on this text make sure that's the only thing that matters and when you make this text Big on screen

###### 7

well guess what any other text on screen becomes relatively smaller both literally and figuratively now without a doubt this is the thing that has all of my attention at this point if you just follow these really simple steps and this doesn't take much to do anyone can do this you should be about 90% of the way there with eliminating distractions and being able to stay focused in obsidian if you want to go the extra 10% there's a really neat plug-in that allows you to have some ambient music in the background you might find that that increases your distractions but some of you might also find that you need just some sort of background ambient noise to stay focused sometimes I'm in Camp a other times I'm in Camp B so just depending on where your levels of distractability might be I encourage you to try out this one so what we're going to do is uncollapse deolapar and now we're going to go back down to this settings icon when we do that we're going to go to community plugins now I'm going to not just search for installed plugins but browse the community plugins

###### 8

and all you need to do here is type sound so if I type sound I'll see soundscapes and this is what we're looking for I'll click on that I'll go ahead and hit install it's doing its business and now you can see it's successfully installed we're going to go ahead and hit enable we can go ahead and click on options I don't think I really touch any of the options here so I'm now just going to exit out of settings so at this point what you might notice is in the bottom bar I'm going to zoom out just one so we can read that a little bit easier and what you'll notice is there's a play button so if I hit this play button now we have low five Beats from YouTube playing in the background and if I click this playlist button you can see there's more than just that playlist at our fingertips we have all these different potential channels maybe you want the Cozy fire fireplace the birds chirping relaxing jazz is a really good one and I tend to like synthwave synth wve radio every now and then to really get

###### 9

in the zone when I'm working on something deep so just depending on where you're at you can choose a playlist that works for you now I find that this actually does not increase the distractions I typically go with one channel and then after about 60 seconds I'm in it I'm in the ambience and I'm really focused because of it now think about the reverse without soundscapes what you have to do is go on the internet browser again all the distractions of the internet and particularly YouTube staring you in the face good luck not clicking on one video and ending up going down the rabbit hole when you have an option to just hit play Within obsidian it really is a subtle Difference Maker and if you're looking to go the extra 10% to eliminate distractions because you're really feeling there's just so much going on that's when you want to turn to the ambient music we want to figure out our soundscapes and the best way to actually do that is with the soundscapes plugin so I hope you enjoy that technique to eliminate distractions and stay focused in obsidian now before we recap all
