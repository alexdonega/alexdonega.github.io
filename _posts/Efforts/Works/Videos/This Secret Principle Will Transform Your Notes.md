###### 1

in any effort of ours we can only Garden or architect those are the two archetypes one prioritizes curiosity the other order the problem is we often get stuck in one and we need both and that's what this talk is about I gave it in the Netherlands at the PKM Summit and there are links below if you want to join the next ones in the Netherlands and the US in 2025 my goal for the talk is to show how the architect and Gardener framework is one of the most empowering Frameworks for any of our problem solving and creative efforts and how you can use linked notes to reliably move between these Styles this is a longer video I'm proud of it if you have the time I think you'll enjoy it growing up uh our family celebrated Christmas and one Christmas we all gathered around Christmas Eve we gathered around the Christmas tree and like many who might celebrate Christmas all the kids I have two older brothers we ask the same question that many many kids ask on Christmas Eve do you know what that question is can we open presents early and my dad

###### 2

said sure if if you can answer my riddle and that's when he shared with us my favorite riddle the riddle the two paths here's the abbreviated version on your and if you if you know the answer don't share it don't blurt it out and I will provide some hints at the end you can come see me come up to me afterwards and I will share with you what the answer is on your journey to happiness you come to a fork in the road One path leads to Eternal happiness we don't know which path and another path leads to Eternal sadness you can't tell which path is which luckily for you two identical trolls with hooked noses and big sausage fingers they're lounging around they're eating rabbits and they're on big tree stumps and you've heard of this place and these trolls you know that one troll can only tell lies and one troll can only tell the truth and you cannot tell these trolls apart even worse to figure out the path that leads to happiness that's where you want to go you want to go to the Happy way you can only ask one

###### 3

question to one of the trolls after that they'll just ignore you and eat more rabbit which question then do you ask to figure out which road leads to happiness h i loved that riddle I was upside down on the couch back back on the floor feet on the couch staring up at the Christmas tree and about that time unexpectedly surprisingly the answer came to me at the end of the speech I'll share with you what that answer was so no one can get out early you're stuck you're stuck with me part of that answer though is what leads us into a history of dualities a a history of dualities and we're going to come back to architect and Gardener but first I want to talk a little bit about tasks and ideas and how we might want to treat them differently we can think of tasks as something that are is relatively finite it has a beginning it has an end we can typically understand when we cross it off conversely ideas might have a specific finite use but can be reused used differently thought of differently combined shaped Twisted crafted who knows what it's

###### 4

really infinite tasks are hard ideas soft malleable tasks are clear whereas ideas are fuzzy and the thing that makes tasks different than ideas is that we can't manage ideas the way we manage projects and tasks and the reason why is because the scope of work is unclear and the rate of change with ideas it's too fast tasks sweet floor we can do that tasks make the bed here's another great task that probably most of us have done at some point is a DAV and Allen inspired mind sweep how wonderful is that to just get all that psychic Ram freed up so we can focus with all of our attention on the things that matter to us but ideas they're not so clear we can't just cross them off we might for some reason here hear what steuart brand had to say about Pace layers and we say wo I love that that's a great way for me to understand how systems work how very complex systems work or we might be writing a book a novel some some fiction and we think we might want to change the character's backstory so what we do when

###### 5

we change something in chapter one is going to have Ripple effects on all the subsequent chapters so there's a lot of nonlinearity there are a lot of complex dependencies if we try to manage our ideas like we manage our tasks inevitably we fail and then we look for a different solution we're back to these sh shiny object syndrome where all of a sudden we're looking for that next app that is going to allow us to accomplish the problem but the problem when it comes to ideas is rarely what we think it is often times is that we're not treating them as a gardener but this goes further and so I want to actually Zoom us back even more to something that need wrote about tying it back to Greece and two different Greek gods Apollo and dianis and Apollo apollonian thinking is appolloni style of thought is thinking it's logical and it's ordered and then Dian is a feeling emotional it's chaotic and when we're creating something when we're working with ideas which think about how you work with ideas one thing that I've realized the more the longer I be the that I'm in

###### 6

PKM is how I know even less than I thought I knew and all of us are doing something different with ideas and how we manage them but this balance is always ever present and a lot of our art whatever it is that we are creating has to do a lot with this this framework but this framework has been brought into modern times with something that's a little bit more comfortable for us a little bit more familiar a little bit more intuitive and that is the AR and Gardener framework I'm going to argue that this is one of the most valuable Frameworks that we can have working in the back of our mind when we are trying to make forward progress on our ideas and if we ever feel that we're stuck we can just swap switch move between one mode of thinking to another style of thinking George R Martin famously is said there are two types of writers The Architects and the gardeners The Architects plan everything ahead of time the gardeners dig a hole drop a seed and water it raise of hands who here thinks that they tend to naturally be an

###### 7

architect okay and who here thinks the opposite that they naturally tend to be a gardener okay I think that's a relative split maybe gardener about 55% let's jump into it then let's get to the definitions and learn a little bit more Architects and gardeners why is this framework so important because we're dealing with problem solving and creative efforts so think in whatever it is that you do your use cases what are you problem solving what are you thinking about that's what are we trying to manage what are we trying to get across the finish line and then there's something else and those are those creative efforts This truly is a broad framework it can apply to all sorts of situations but I need you now I'm challenging you now to say how does this apply to me how does this apply to my efforts so we just looked at the little bit of a natural tendency we asked ourselves here's a little bit more of the definition Architects are top- down thinkers that prioritize order and structure conversely gardeners are bottomup thinkers that prioritize chaos and curiosity do we think we prioritize chaos I don't

###### 8

think too many of us are like oh I need some more chaos in my life today but when it comes to the certain energy you're enthusiasm or curiosity when it comes with our work that is what the gardener is prioritizing now sometimes we spend a lot of time in that architect mind that top- down thinking other times we do the opposite we're in curiosity mode we're going down rabbit Trails on the internet which never end and we're in gardening mode and then we get a little overwhelmed so what do we do we go back to architect mode mode so we can make sense of that stuff that's what we should be doing but sometimes we feel bad about it or we feel there's something not quite right so we're going to look at ways to maybe be a little bit better about this thing that we're doing naturally all the time now we ask this question are you more of an architect or Gardener you raised your hands one or the other now here's a great way to think about it now I challenge you what are you working on what's your problem what's your

###### 9

creative effort all right have that in your mind and now here's the question to help us really figure out what we might be do you know the end do you know the end of your story you might be writing an essay do you have it outlined boom boom boom boom now I just have to write it you might be an architect if you don't if you're going by the seats of your seat of your pants you might be a gardener in the writing world that's sometimes known as a paner exactly hey if you're enjoying this you might be interested in my new workshop writing original Works which unites the architect and Gardener archetypes so that you can create your best work reliably if you're interested check out the link in the description below all right let's keep going so now that's pretty great we we did some definitional work but I really want to make this come alive in meetings this goes beyond notes this goes into everything that you do not just with yourself but with others as well and the way we can look at this is by unhealthy and healthy Tendencies let's

###### 10

start with the unhealthy ones the unhealthy architect tendency tell me if this has ever been you Architects whove raised your hand fragile thinking you need to see the big picture when taken too far your tendency for top- down thinking can lead to stifling rigid thinking when that need sets in you can become paralyzed when you don't have enough structure this can manifest in coming across as needy and overburdening to others sometimes it can even turn brainstorming sessions into prosecutions has this been you it's been me it's been me for sure when I had a co-founder of pink gloves boxing so we were having a session trying to think about how we're going to expand this this Fitness boxing program into universities if that's something we wanted to do and I was drilling my partner and friend Garrett to give me all the answers well he didn't know it's because it was a brainstorming session and I was treating it like something else like a prosecution so that was me being Fragile with my architect so just to give everyone a heads up I tend to skew architect which is why some gardening methods maybe balance

###### 11

me out maybe allow me to unlock some areas that are a little bit more difficult but gardeners scattered thinking when taken too far your tendency for bottomup thinking can lead to a chronic sense of anxiety around trying to find things whether it's the car keys or your old notes our tendency for unhealthy bottom-up thinking is to chronically collect new and exciting information never to touch it again is this you yes you probably can identify yourself in all of these right and and that's important to recognize because if we can recognize it then we can build up an intuitive sense of when we're in the wrong place and then we can know when we need to switch so that's what we're aiming for now let's just check out those healthy Tendencies when an architect is operating in a healthy way when they're operating in this healthy way convergent thinking you enjoy seeing the big picture you prefer knowing more about a subject or situation before you act you like categorizing and you use the big picture to further your decision- making and overall sense making you're good organizer and you benefit from having a few list

###### 12

to guide your actions a question though is can you go from that convergent thinking but be loose enough to allow for these emergent ideas to form these insights from your work that is a question to keep it healthy can you see yourself in this okay let's look at the bottom Divergent thinking gardeners when they're healthy are Divergent they're capable capable of operating without having a highle picture they're able to work with limited information and follow the trail of enthusiasm Clues and connections they generate a lot of thoughts but that question then becomes can you go from Divergent thinking to emergent thinking in this middle in this Estuary between riverwater saltwater where the life is very abundant in this mixture so if you want to take a screenshot this is a great time just to have these handy moving on 3 2 one okay architects in a nutshell like order gardeners don't mind a mess okay next part now how do folders and links affect the way that we think how do they affect the way that we think notes before links folders helped us organize but not to think so is that Gardener or architect

###### 13

AR totally architect documents were required to live in a single place and that was good for files but it's not so good for ideas or ideation the development of ideas and if we think about it is this how our brains work do they work with folders that are hierarchial and you open this one and then you go to that one I would venture to say they do not folders then Force architecting hey and that's great if that's what you need at that time but now imagine that architect is already your tendency that you go towards and now you have folders that are doubling down on that tendency and you're wondering why you're stuck you're wondering why the project has ground to a halt it's because we're doubling up on architecting there's no time for that emergent energy that bottomup energy that might be the thing that gets us to the other side folders there's a green folder and there's a red folder you're ready to seize the day you're going to make progress you have your to-do list because hey you're an architect right and then you have a new idea it's an apple where

###### 14

do we put it and then you're like well I don't know how to answer this one so then what do you do you spend your entire day forgetting your task list and you redesign your entire PKM system because this time it's going to be perfect and then a day later it's okay then a week later you're thinking oh yeah month later please don't bring that up I'm ashamed so folders Force this question in which folder does this idea exclusively belong it's full of friction and it's kind of low value like what value is created by answering this question that is forced upon you a little that's why I say a low it's not nothing but maybe there's something better that you could do in the same amount of time so let's talk about notes after links so with links we have a bit of a network that can be formed over time the whole becomes more than the sum of its part of its parts we can grow ideas in richness over time we can create intellectual assets we can foster insights and Innovations we have just five basic levels new idea to seed we

###### 15

develop them Forest of ideas Forest of notes that alost and would go here um we can put some of these onto a place that we can view them I like to call that a map or a map of content we can have multiple maps and then we have a place at the top that has the most structure that gets us exact where we need to go maybe a home note links in this way modulate modes we can see that links Don't Force just the blue architect but we can actually move between two different modes of thinking just with notes that can link to other notes easily so now when we see apple we don't have to say in which one folder does this note belong so what do we ask in instead what do links cause us to ask tacitly invisibly hidden what do we ask if we're thinking as an architect we might say something like well what is this a part of if we're thinking like a gardener we can say what does it relate to what's going on here and then in the middle maybe a little bit of so what why

###### 16

do I even care why am I even here another internet Rabbit Hole perhaps so what's going on here these are generative they're high value questions in sense making which is What's Happening Here in the process of sense making we naturally are creating value how powerful is that if that becomes the Habit that you do day in and day out pretty good huh H H so we go from Apple into this system and out comes something that wasn't in the system to begin with that's Emer thinking so we get what it was supposed to be and you tell me if it is or not not just an apple pie but apparently a Dutch apple pie yeah no maybe okay that's what happens though we can go from Apple to apple pie when we have a rich system that allows us to think as an architect and as a gardener and we'll get into a few of these exercises we want to oscillate modes to pump intuition and uncover insights all right are we ready there's another riddle so we had the Riddle at the start we have a riddle and I will uh I will spoil

###### 17

this one but then we'll have another riddle and then you can always come up to me and I can give you the answer so here's the first one what single word and don't spoil this for anyone okay so if you know don't don't blurt it out loud the reason I say that all the time the spoiler thing one I don't want to spoil the ending but when I was a little kid there was a movie called The Sixth Sense with Bruce Willis are we familiar with this okay and there's a bit of a Twist in that one and the problem with the twist was my two brothers I mentioned they're both older than me so of course they went to see it and well at that age I wanted to sound cool so like did you see it Nick and I was like yeah and then they said well when did you know du du du and I was like oh I didn't I didn't I was just trying to be cool and because I was trying to be cool the end of six sense was ruined for me so that's why I don't like

###### 18

spoilers but it turns out there's a deeper reason what one word is a compound word for these three words so again keep this to yourself if you think what it is what could this be so think on this one and I might be the very next slide so if you don't want to be swelled but close your eyes but rest assured there's a new riddle coming up right after this but what you might do to solve this is you might focus on it intensely you might try to use logic to figure it out move things around figure out the order of things architect our way to a solution that is perfectly a fine route to go you might also then take a break and allow that more looser form of thinking how can these things relate maybe something will just spark and come to be so you move it around and eventually boom you get to what it might be and I won't say it out loud but there it is that is the solution let's do one more this one with no answer you'll have to come see me later these three words what

###### 19

is the one word that is a compound word for each of these three what's the answer do you want it find me later okay so now the title of this talk was Architects and gardeners how to be both with linked notes we know what it is we know Tendencies I think we have an understanding why we might want to be both so we can keep moving forward on the problems that we're trying to solve and on our creative efforts a few exercises that we'll be going through now are right here you can call these things anything you want I think it's helpful to have some sort of sticky catchy name and we'll we'll be going through each of these now with a with a focus as you'll notice on the bottom part because this is relatively new for us with link notes and everything so we could spend time on foldering but I think we've all had practice for decades on folders we're going to spend a little bit more time with what's possible using only links and mainly from the bottom up but that last one is going to uh be from the top

###### 20

down so spark to this is something that can just bridge the gap between collecting ideas and connecting them I'm a huge advocate to not just take notes but to make notes and there's a major difference there one can be passive typically becomes passive as more time goes on the other cannot it has to be active it has to be engaged so what is the likelihood that note making is going to be a low value activity it's a low likelihood because we have to be active and engaged so whatever we come up with as we make a note we write it in our own words we connect it to something else we can do all sorts of things but we're making the note we're not just copying and pasting we're not just highlighting in the process of the making we generate we create we identify things that we never expected before and I want to give us just a very simple framework that we can practice in our notes and in our conversations with each other today and tomorrow at some point you might say hm that's interesting and then instead of stopping there try to

###### 21

then get into the one-word habit of saying because what's going to come out I don't know but that's the fun it forces us to say something and we won't like it we won't like what we say half the time but that's great because then upon hearing it and seeing it we can say well not like that like this now we rewrite now we rethink and that whole time we're in the enriching process not of copying not of pasting but of sense making so we want to slam these two thoughts together and because and the way we get there are with a few connecting pieces a few blanks so let's look at some of my favorite easy prompts we might say hm that's interesting because or we might say oh that's important that's important because or if you are working on something and you're losing enthusiasm go to it's important like why am I even here maybe there's something deep within you losing enthusiasm because it's not that important to what you're doing maybe we should listen to that voice but sometimes it is so we need to tell ourselves why my might be something that's

###### 22

really important and underrated but I'm going to encourage it is that in our reverence of of research fact rigorous analysis we don't think we have the right to have an opinion I want us to just hold that thought somewhere else and for a moment say you not only have a right but you must or else you're you're doing yourself your mind a disservice so when we encounter something it is okay at least to yourself to say hm that's good because and then whatever you say that doesn't mean whatever you say out loud it's not going to be etched on your Tombstone or whatever else it's just a thought and once you say it out loud you can say yeah I don't even believe that but you've thought it and you have something to work with when it comes to this thinking game half of the half the thinking game is just getting it out tangible and visible so now it can become shapable because if it's never out if it's just held within us then we become someone who continues to consume which is fine until it's not when we feel like ah why am

###### 23

I so frustrated why do I all this stuff well it's because we have to do this we have to open up we have to say it's good because it's bad because and force ourselves to be opinionated sometimes next on the architect side of things it's part of blank because or a favorite one because of just how casual it is and how it can connect to my personal memories which in the work that we do connecting something to what matters to us is not only it's not self- serving it's not oh look at me I'm gazing at my navl it is a way for us to remember the more something is about us the more that we can remember it and what I mean by that is tight to specific memory we were doing a live sense making session and the concept that we decided to work on it wasn't Pace layers it wasn't anti- fragile it was a a person that we turned into a concept for the sake of the exercise Tom Cruz and so you had to say Tom Cruz is good because Tom Cruz is bad because we did all these prompts

###### 24

uh Tom Cruz reminds me and little did I well and the responses were amazing some some people said uh it reminds me that Colts are Insidious other people said that reminds me of my first date uh for me personally it took me back to the cine4 theater in Great Falls Montana and watching the original Mission Impossible with my dad and my oldest brother my dad's not around anymore so memories like that are precious and I didn't have access to that memory I had lost it until this activity and so I wrote about it the next day I called my brother he filled in details I didn't wasn't aware of because he's 6 years older how amazing that's nothing to do with getting a project complete but has everything to do with living a meaningful life and creating an idea verse a web a knowledge Network that is Meaningful to an individual last two you can say it's similar to blank it's different from blank so you know some of these are a little bit more creative and some of these can be critical they can be analytical and we can do both we can do

###### 25

both so similar to different from that's our analytical Minds now we're going to be able to parse the differences it's not just all fun and rainbows we can actually say and we can make all of those nuanced separations let's move on to the the next exercise name it to frame it name the to frame the idea a strongly stated Min thesis of the ideas within so who here is familiar with Andy matusak uh okay Andy matusak his daily um his Evergreen notes he has specific definitions of what an evergreen note is typically though we're just going to focus today we're just focusing on the title of a note what do you call something how many of us here practice a daily note like you have a daily note it opens up for that day okay so you might start in a daily note you capture something that resonates you say hm that's interesting because and you type in your daily note but then it really grows and you say you know I'm going to make this into its own note but what am I going to call it well that's actually a great question it's

###### 26

a valuable question I mean that like it's a great valuable question because in figuring out how what to name it we are sense making we're creating value so you might have something throughout your day that Sparks but you don't know why maybe there's a social phenomena this weekend that you find and that really intrigues you hm maybe it's your PKM system what do you name your PKM system to personalize it for you you can call it whatever you can call it PKM that's perfectly fine but you might find that there's something else that speaks to you more so these are just some notes that I've named I was reading a book uh Foundation by Isaac azov and there's something about the Seldon crisis I was reading it around the 2020 us election and it kind of seemed to me that this key moment when the future of the entire galaxy is decided kind of felt like the 2020 election now the funny part about that work is everyone thinks everything's a seld in crisis so anyways that is just a random personal note here are a few others look at the titles name it to

###### 27

frame it great works are flavored by early works I didn't know that that's what I was interested in what I was interested in is that Beethoven created a few works and then 20 years later it led to his Ninth Symphony but the bones were in his earlier Works wow what's that all about or Herman Hessa uh sidartha it's his spiritual Coming of Age sort of book but his one that won him the Nobel Prize was the glass bead game in 1943 and both are kind of these stories where you watch a character from their youth all the way through their life and their ups and downs and the lessons they learn so his early Works were the bones of his future works great works are flavored by early Works &m stacking M ammo that's what he calls his PKM flow and you know other thoughts on acting and other things Half Baked thoughts uh I'm trying to describe why clusters are so great maybe I can use emojis but there's really nothing there a couple other things it's just a mess but it's my mess that I understand I created everything here I mean not

###### 28

every word maybe there are a few quotes there's a transcript bit there but everything was put together by me which means it has meaning and then when I am entering some conversations with some of you today maybe some of the things these things naturally come up because maybe you mention it or you mention something and it's just adjacent to one of these ideas and we have a great conversation and that's enough so these are ways that we can be a gardener and I want to finish with Garden master it's just a way to revisit notes and gently cultivate them so has anyone here been to a Japanese style Garden yeah they're pretty impressive everything is in harmony it it's beautiful it's calming it's Serene what a garden Master does the the master in charge a niwashi which is Garden master in Japanese is that they move around they have a plan so they have an architect mind actually more than we think but then day in day out they're walking around and they might say hm that maybe trim this this H okay they're thinking they're going back to their notes so I might start

###### 29

with something that in ai ai such a big wave there's a magic there's a magic to Ai and then someone said but eventually it's going to become mundane and then randomly I was like you know there there's something here there's something like a a spectrum a Continuum so I ended up writing magic to mundane meter write something about this that was it and then over time it became okay write something about this here's a list of ideas that you can work with so I'm cultivating as a garden Master coming back to this thing maybe it was a couple days later and then a week later and then a couple I was like yeah something about compound interest is Magic right that that that kind of sound feels like magic and then oh that makes me think of that Arthur C Clark quote any sufficient ly Advanced Technologies indistinguishable indistinguishable from Magic and eventually it becomes a piece and becomes an article this is one workflow I'm not saying it's your workflow as I said we all have our own use cases but in this particular one I went from a spark to remarks went from

###### 30

remarks I related things together and I was able to communicate something and share it with others let's go to map maker and this will be how we finish how we collect and cluster ideas as a gardener we capture from the nothingness into the somethingness now there are notes Here notes that we capture and then we have a forest of notes that's sort of like our zle Casten notes everywhere now we can start connecting them and it's great over time we connect these ideas we develop notes that gain color and flavor and complexity but it gets a little messy over time doesn't it so notes fall away all this stuff and then we say you know I want to do something so we throw some of those notes onto a higher order note that we might call a map so or a map of content so now that we have these notes Here we can what do we do in that first one in this first one we are collecting we are gathering we know we want to do that when we hit a mental squeeze point so basically we have been in this Gardener mindset

###### 31

or something is going on with our gardener being on overdrive and we need to get over the stuck point so what do we do we use links to make a map now we're more of an architect mind we first collect to calm but now we can cluster so now we're clustering and when we do clustering if you remember one thing from this presentation clustering might be it because now we can have something magical happen truly magical when you just put ideas or people in a room together magic happens we have Sparks of inspiration we see things in new ways and we start to develop the thoughts that are there and so boom two things close

###### 32

together and that one note becomes more welldeveloped same thing over here boom something else develops so this is where we create clusters clusters clusters cause tension and tension requires resolution but there's negative space between the Clusters that's part two now we get to map that Gap something was missing boom new note new insight generated that we wer even thinking about and now we have something special to give others and now this is a map of a summation of our thought of our thoughts and what's neat about that is not only are we more organized but then those seed the rest of the garden which is our own intellectual Capital over time so then on our next project we're not starting from a blank page we can organize we can develop and there you have it we can seed ideas and that's how we are Architects and gardeners how we can be both with linked notes now just a couple conclusions before we get out of here how do we break through these sticking points in a nutshell when we get stuck when you get stuck and you will multiple times in a day what does

###### 33

that mean confused frustrated overwhelmed bored it's a sign that you need to switch modes so imagine you're stuck gardening here if you're stuck in the weeds take off The Gardener's hat and build some perspective by putting all your notes ideas links into a single note a map and then cluster them together and see what happens but if you're lost in abstraction because you're an architect naturally and you love structure stop building it it's probably unearned instead jump into action by writing that's going to get you back into the gardener mode so that's how we can weave between the micro and the macro and you'll break through those sticking points stay engaged with the material longer and create more meaningful work than you ever would by sticking with st one style alone so now just to conclude about that riddle I was upside down looking at the Christmas tree right and the this the answer came to me you know what it was it was my brother Steve walking out of the computer room we didn't have cell phones at the time and he blurted out the answer cuz he just went on the internet so

###### 34

yay we get to open presents how awesome is that we get to open a present on Christmas Eve but my brother robed me of a riddle and once robbed I I can't get that riddle back but it allowed me to understand the deeper riddle and one that I want to leave you with today he may have walked out with the answer to the riddle but what I've realized is the answer to the riddle is truly the riddle itself and if we can move between these two modes we can play with those riddles and we can solve The Riddles the problemss and our own creative efforts and everything we do in our lives thanks so much okay so did you enjoy the talk what stands out to you please let me know in the comments below and if you want to learn handson how to write as both an architect and Gardener and develop a reliable writing process then click the writing original Works Link in the description below to learn about this one-of-a-kind highly unique Workshop or if you just like to jump start your obsidian Journey then click here to watch obsidan for beginners
