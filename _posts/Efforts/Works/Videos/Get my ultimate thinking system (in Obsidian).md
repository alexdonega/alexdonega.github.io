What would it feel like to have all of your ideas available to you reliably at any time? That's the promise of an "idea verse" - a place where all your knowledge is connected, a place where your ideas go to live, a place that powers and supports your mind and the actions you take in the world around you. And yes, you can have one. Imagine how much calmer and confident you could feel in your thoughts and actions. Imagine how much clarity you could gain. Imagine how much more effective you could be in all your efforts. Here's how we get there: 1. Have a "home" note that centers your mind and launches your thinking. 2. Have a space and system to develop your ideas and reliably remember important information and insights. 3. Have a space and system to capture new sparks and focus your day. 4. Reflect on your direction. 5. Have a space and system to intuitively manage your efforts. Learn how these three spaces match the three "heads" spaces of personal knowledge management. Experience the clear context switch each space provides. Learn how the three core folders match these three headspaces for a unified system.

maps of content not just to index information but to catalyze your thinking and to generate some of your most inspired work. See how maps of content help you navigate your ideas. Learn how to make notes not just mechanically take them and how making notes creates a habit that creates value for you and through all of this, feel how linking your thinking works to support and empower your mind and the actions you take in the world around you. All of this is available today in "idea verse Pro," but first, you'll have to drop some of the paradigms from toxic productivity to get there. An "idea verse" isn't only about productivity - it's about PKM, which stands for personal knowledge management. The world of knowledge and ideas is complex, and narrow-minded, white-knuckled, self-shamers out there are on a one-way route to burnout. We'd like to think the path we take is linear, but it's not - it curves and swerves, hops and skips. If our thinking is fragile and not agile, we might march headfirst into a ditch, especially with how fluid the modern world has become. This is where an "idea verse" empowers you in unexpected

ways that other people can only call luck. While it can help you be extremely prolific, an "idea verse" also encourages a sense of creativity, connectivity, exploration, and wander. As once said quite well in a book by JRR Tolkien, "Not all those who wander are lost." Now more than ever, those who wander are those who win life's long game because they balance action with reflection and achieve a robust ability to move through life effectively and joyfully. That is the power of an "idea verse," and you can have your own. Let's build it together. Good luck, stay connected, and we'll see you on the inside.
