PKM is a new term to describe an old problem: "How do we make sense of the world?" Maybe you're trying to get through history class or write your dissertation for PhD. Maybe you've gone down the internet rabbit hole into some fascinating topic, but you don't want to forget everything by next week. Maybe you're putting together a grocery list or a list of to-dos for the day. Maybe you're working your way in a new career, trying to track who's who and how and how that's relevant to your aspirations. Maybe you just love ideas and you get inspired and blown away by how the plow (yes, the plow) changed humanity. Maybe you want to track your dreams, your heart rate, or your workouts over time. Maybe you want to remember the memories you had with cherished friends and family, some of whom aren't around anymore except in memory. Maybe you want to figure out how to go about living a good life - something the ancient Greeks might call eudaimonia. If you do anything like this, then you're managing knowledge - that's PKM, that's personal knowledge management.
