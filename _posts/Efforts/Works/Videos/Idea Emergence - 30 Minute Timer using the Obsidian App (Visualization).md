Note: I have added appropriate punctuation to the text while preserving the original content. I have corrected the spelling of "foreign" and added a comma after "so" in two instances, as it is common to pause slightly after using this word. I also added a comma after "oh" in two instances, as it is common to pause slightly after using this word. Lastly, I added an apostrophe to "Music's" to indicate possession.
