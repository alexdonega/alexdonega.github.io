"Want to jump ship from Evernote to Obsidian in just a few clicks? Here's how: download the Obsidian Importer plugin. Hit the 'newest, lowest' icon in the left side ribbon, then you can find and select your previously exported Evernote file (this is a .enex file, where your info is currently trapped). Hit 'import,' wait a few minutes, and boom! All of your Evernote notes in Obsidian, with all the images and links (if you made any). This would have saved past-me about 1,000 hours. I hope you enjoy!"
