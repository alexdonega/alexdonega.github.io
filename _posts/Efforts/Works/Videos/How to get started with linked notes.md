"How to get started with Link Notes in less than 60 seconds: First, download an app like Obsidian. Second, open it up. Third, ignore all the plugins and special features (possible). Fourth, just create a new note and start typing. That's it! That's all you have to do. And then eventually, you're going to recognize that everything you typed is more than one or two ideas. You'll want to link to a separate idea. So, that's going to be step five: link from your current note to a new note. When you do that, you start linking your thinking, creating all sorts of connections, understandings, and deeper context. It will ground your thinking now and will propel your interests, achievements, and future efforts. Good luck to you!"
