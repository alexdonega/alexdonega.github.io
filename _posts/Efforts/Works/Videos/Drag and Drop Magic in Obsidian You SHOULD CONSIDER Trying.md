Did you know you can drag and drop in Obsidian from a data view query? Let me show you how. Well, first, you can just drag and drop whenever you have too many panes in one and you want to move them into a separate one, like this. So, I'm getting a little overwhelmed. I want to create a new map of my recent ideas, and I have this cool data view query that allows me to see my recently created notes. So, I'm just going to drag and drop, like that. This works really well for me when I'm dragging and dropping idea notes. Notes, I kind of want to play around with a little bit later. So, you can see, I'm just trying to find those idea notes, and I might scroll down a bit. Um, yeah, here's a good one: "Haka." So, I'll throw this one in, and now I can just work with those ideas right here. I hope this is helpful! Try it out for yourself. It's pretty nice.
