I'm an accidental Creator I'm somebody who was just kind of like back pedling and then fell backwards into the party and then looked around and said whoa what's going on here uh I was happily in TV working my way up as a TV editor and the last show I worked on was better colol which is at the top of the game nominated for I think over 50 emys this was the best show ever the people on it were super creative and kind I was in my happy place working on this show I created a Fitness Boxing business along with my friend and business partner Garrett girls we co-founded a Fitness Boxing business that's become International it's called pink gloves boxing it's still running today and really proud of that and then around 2013 I moved from Montana to New York City I got involved at HBO and a bunch of different things and I was a PA so I was the person who would have to shlep soggy cheeseburgers across town for lunch and grab the producer random coffees and cappuccinos whenever they wanted that
