every note ever written at any time in any place that was the original tagline for ever note in 2004. now before we get into that story you have questions like where exactly should you put your old notes is it really worth switching from Evernote to something else and hey Nick what do you have against Evernote can you tell me exactly where they hurt you and don't worry I'm going to cover so much in this video so please feel free to skip to the section that you need first we'll cover evernote's Icarus moment the exact moment it started to crash then we'll cover who should actually stay in Evernote and there are a few people then who should switch to obsidian and then how to manage the switch like where do your old files go and how do you transfer them into your new Vault then we'll get into the weeds and dive into evernote's five CEOs and their goals in a single word then the four factors truly behind evernote's free fall and finally where exactly Evernote hurt me an untold story about this pain that Evernote caused me but now let's get into the

###### 2

exact moment Evernote crashed and it's not what you think every note ever written at any time in any place that was ever notes original vision from founder steppen patikov we know that that was the original tagline for ever note because Harry McCracken was in the room where it happened McCracken is basically the world's top journalist of Evernote he's been covering it from 2004 all the way to today now fast forward four years when Apple opened the iPhone app store in July of 2008. Evernote was a day one launch and it grew so massively that by the time CEO Phil libben bounded on stage in October 4th of 2013. Evernote had amassed a user base of 75 million and I loved Evernote at that time and I've largely failed to thank for ushering it into the mainstream but along with the announcement of a new version for the iPhone Phil kept going and announced Evernote backpacks Evernote wallets socks 2 I believe according to McCracken Livin sound and startled himself as he said in a good humor we're a fashion brand now and there it was in a single Illuminating sentence evernote's Icarus moment Evernote wanted

###### 3

to be the Nike for smart people but their expansion into fashion along with their Epic feature blow doomed the company to spiral into a free fall for the past decade and now it's extremely unlikely that it will ever soar to the heights that it once did instead today competitors like notion and obsidian have all the magic they've taken over the sufficiently Epic Quest for everyone in the world to have their own ideaverse a place where they can find what they've written in the words of evernote's founder at any time in any place now let's get into the nitty-gritty of who actually might not want to switch out of Evernote the best way to show this is by hopping into our notes so let's go for it alright now what you see once more is my script for this video it's so easy to do this in obsidian so now we are at who shouldn't switch now you shouldn't switch for three major reasons and let's get into these three reasons number one you are using Evernote as a static archive to clip articles so essentially you're more of a collector than a Creator hey and

###### 4

that's cool too or at least for this part of your system you're just collecting things you're clipping things and you like to have a backup if you want to use Evernote as your anti-library go ahead and keep doing that it's really effective the best tool that Evernote ever came out with is likely the Web Clipper because it allows you to clip articles so easily it's also its most dangerous tool that we'll get to by the end of the video however if you are using this as a static archive hey it's perfect for that now number two you might want to stay if you don't do much synthesizing of information or managing your complex efforts so Evernote is really good as a storage container it's really effective as bins where you put stuff but when it's about mixing that stuff you need a Next Generation thinking tool number three you don't need a switch if you are not saving personal information or journaling or you don't care that much that other people are using your information in ways that you may never really understand basically if you using Evernote as a Dusty addict that you barely

###### 5

go into you know it's full of cobwebs you don't want to go up there too often but every now and then you need to find that PDF you need to find that one article that you know you saved it's in there somewhere then go ahead and go up into the attic you might want to keep Evernote around for that but here's the thing you just have to not mind paying for a subscription for the rest of your life just to have access to that PDF to that article so that is definitely something to keep in mind so a lot of you are asking is it really worth the pain of switching for some of you it's not just be mindful of what your goals are and if you're more collecting over creating if you don't need to synthesize information if you're not saving personal information in there if you're treating it more like a storage container like a Dusty Attic that you rarely need to go into you can keep using Evernote especially if you don't mind paying that subscription for the rest of your life just have access now that drives me crazy just

###### 6

to have access like it just it does so those are the reasons however that you might not want to switch you don't have to you don't have to chase the nice and shiny however you you might want to for the following three reasons let's just go into it this is all Happening by the way in the tool of my choice which is Obsidian and I just I love it dearly again just just be clear about this because I talk about obsidian a lot they don't uh they don't pay me anything I've never asked they've never asked it's just this is the tool that brings me joy so you know here I am I want it to bring you Joy too now who should switch you should switch if any of the following three reasons apply to you you want to use notes to think better and generate insights that means you want more of that creating energy as opposed to just the collecting Energy number two you use notes to synthesize information to bring these ideas together spark new insights and manage pretty complex efforts sometimes and number three this happens to me because I

###### 7

have to share this stuff publicly a lot but in Evernote it really happened where I would kind of censor what I was writing because I just didn't trust that other people didn't have access to it there are still platforms that I use where I do censor what I say because I know hey it's out there it's not protected as my local notes that I have on my computer that I use with obsidian basically if you want a supercharged sense making machine where you learn faster think better and create more than a tool like obsidian is going to give you a better environment for those goals so that's when you'll want to switch and a little side note here I want to touch on this at the end because I have a secret reason for getting you to switch I'm going to cover that right near the end okay but now a reason a lot of you are here you might be thinking I want to do the switch but I just don't know a few of those details like where do I put those old files so how to manage your old files and there

###### 8

are just a couple things basically how do you handle the switch now in a previous video over here or here somewhere I covered how to export from Evernote and import into obsidian so check that one out and what we want to cover in this one however is a little bit more focus and Nuance around where are you putting your old Evernote Vault how are you handling transferring notes from that Old Vault into your main one so let's just dive into that a little bit and that's kind of why I'm sharing my full screen here because it's a little hard to show this but I did prepare a little bit so you can see you know this is my file system and I just want to show a couple things so if I go to Dropbox which I use this is my Dropbox you can see how simple and clean it is so I have a folder for when other people who use Dropbox share stuff with me and then Dropbox has this apps folder but otherwise we just use the ace folder structure and it's beautiful so we are going to go into Atlas which

###### 9

I have over here and this is about having an all vaults section and I want you to think of a vault as something that you may have used in the past or present where you manage all sorts of information basically it is your PKM system what does pcam stand for personal Knowledge Management so that's a word that if you're new here you'll hear very often we don't want to use too many acronyms but we can't help it sometimes PKM personal Knowledge Management so I have a few different vaults and let me just make this a little bit bigger so you can see now I have my you could consider lyt light my business but I have my vaults and I have shared vaults and you can see how simple this is I have massive amounts of knowledge and information just in these three folders now where does Evernote go so under my vaults I want to look into my past pkms and you'll see right here I have among other apps one for Evernote and I have all the exported files that we did in a previous video I have them here now and the

###### 10

Vault that I might open the old one that I can open in obsidian is right here and not to get too technical with this but we kind of are so if you click on that Evernote folder that works in obsidian the thing that I'm going to do now on a Mac is hit command shift period and we'll see that oh I've already opened it in obsidian and now there's this kind of hidden file structure that gives it all the plugins that it needs and that sort of thing I'm going to close that for now because all we need to do at this point is go to our main Vault click on this thing to open another one we can go ahead and open that folder as a vault then then I'd go and track it down now I've just done that so here it is this is that Evernote this is my old Vault and it's opening up now oh kind of cool so it's doing this indexing for the first time now that it's opening on this computer so it's just kind of neat to know even in Evernote I had links forming with

###### 11

some old projects that's pretty cool so while that's happening I did prepare just a few different notes and I have a couple different walkthroughs this is the Nitty Gritty stuff where it's like how do we Okay I I know I don't want to be an Evernote but how do I get over into obsidian how do I manage this old information number one treat it like the Dusty Attic and I really strongly recommend you don't import everything over into your main vault in a previous video I showed that as the default option just to show you what was possible but what I've done in the past and what I highly recommend is you keep your old Evernote notes completely separate from your main ideaverse because you don't want to bring in all this bag and all this junk into your new space you're just bringing in your old problems to your new home like don't do that let's start fresh in your core idea verse and don't bring all this stuff in then you're thinking oh my mind is split well really is it really like how often do you have to go to the attic

###### 12

to find some winter clothing or something it's probably a rarity that you have to or whatever that junk is under your bed like you don't have to go there too often and that's how you want to treat this and I have a few examples that I want to get through um so if I go back over to my main ideaverse I'm going to open up a note my rhetoric map I happen to love the subject of rhetoric you know the kind of the art of persuasion now that it kind of has some negative connotations but basically can we communicate effectively I think that's a pretty important thing so there's so much involved with it it's so joyful to experience for me and I love the the kind of the ancient slant of it all so I have some different notes in here but I wanna maybe let's focus on this one storytelling transitions but therefore meanwhile this is an old Evernote note so let's actually track it down over here and I'm hoping likely most of the time I do this it has the same title storytelling Transitions and there it is showing up all

###### 13

right so what I did was I copy and pasted everything from here over to a new note here cool that's pretty great now what's interesting is you'll notice in obsidian however I'm thinking about this differently in the original one there's no Uplink there's no top link there's no connection an obsidian really encourages that way of thinking through relationships through context and you know frankly that's how we learn better that's how we remember and recall more effectively so it's so natural to make this storytelling transitions note and then at the top of it have it link back to rhetoric so now I have this link that goes both ways I can always just click on this and come back to the map so if I'm ever in the weeds I just go back up to the map if I'm in the map and I'm like I know there was that thing about like Transitions and stories and then I just go to the rhetoric map and boom I'm in it okay there's one more thing to do now if we go back to finder this Evernote PKM of mine isn't the one that I typically use

###### 14

because I've already combined all these past ekms of mine into a single storage vault which is here I don't want to go too deep into that because that one has some private information in it but all that Evernote stuff exists here so just for the sake of the example however in this currently open vault what I do always is at the end of it I hit two letters DN and boom it says transferred now I have that programmed on a hotkey on Mac don't worry about it the point is this when you want to transfer something to your new Vault give yourself a reminder in the old one that hey I took this out of the attic and now it's synthesized it's assimilated into my new ideaverse and how great does that feel so now I know if I'm ever looking for this and years have gone by and I'm a little unsure then I might go back to the Evernote Vault then I see oh I already transferred it and then I'll just search for some keyword in here and boom I'll be right there so that's how you have Clarity and certainty when

###### 15

you transfer a single file into your main ideaverse that that's where it exists and you have this double check super low Tech super simple by simply just going to the old one and adding transferred into the file name like how simple is that and I was just looking I wanted to just share some other things like here is an image how cool is this like this is part of that import process from Evernote like I love having this handy but again in it's in the storage system I don't need this day to day this is when I was having a fitness boxing program so I don't need this right now what's this one this is a super cool graphic I just like having it handy and some notes on how to improve it in the next iteration so some really neat things here it's nice to go down memory lane kind of like I guess for those who are aware of the movie Chevy Chase and Christmas Vacation he goes up in the attic and he plays the old footage so that's kind of what this feels like I'm just playing the old footage and

###### 16

that's a nice trip down memory lane but I don't necessarily need to spend all this time with the old stuff trying to transfer five thousand whatever notes and files Etc into the new ideaverse it's like no like when you have a need you go back over there and you pull it in okay I hope that gives you so much context I know I went into a lot of details but I think that's oftentimes what you would like to see let me know in the comments below if you like this level of granularity and commentary around this issue because I do know a lot of you have some trepidation around leaving Evernote how do I even do that they put me in these golden handcuffs they attracted me with the shiny and then in the darkness they bound me now I feel like trapped okay anyways that is how you would transfer those old files now we get to stay in obsidian that's how powerful this tool is and I'm just excited to go into really fast evernote's five CEOs and their goals in a single word each okay so here we go here's the list

###### 17

of the CEOs so far number one step in patikov so from 2004 2008 Empower steppen's Vision was to empower us all to have what we needed when we needed it at the right time reliably Phil libben came in and expanded Evernote and that's why we know about it today thanks to Phil's efforts there were some unforeseen complications with that effort to fly so high in the sky that their wings burnt unfortunately Chris O'Neal comes in to try to restructure I think that went decently enough Ian small comes in to try to stabilize all the restructuring and make sure it could be monetized and probably prepare it for what happened recently which is the acquisition of Evernote by an Italian company bending spoons which is where Luca Ferrari comes in what is that goal what will it be in the end if I had to guess right now it's simply to monetize Maybe I'm Wrong so that's what we have we're going to fly through this because we've talked a lot about it already so despite its early success several factors contributed to evernote's decline number one was this urgent need to make money where did

###### 18

that need come from it happens when companies take on venture capitalist money it's amazing that's how we get so so much great growth out of tech companies and they can scale their operations but the dark side is it forces them to think how can we make more money how can we get more out of our best users and the thing was the majority of Evernote users weren't so Keen to upgrade from the free version number two and the one that we can always complain about is feature bloat Evernote just added so many unwanted features and made the software slower less joyful to use and that goes into number three a deluded Vision Evernote confused Everyone by expanding into socks along with scanners backpacks and more and so pachikov's vision of every note ever written at any time in any place that whole Vision started to feel like an afterthought as opposed to the core vision and that was a problem number four increase competition if Google Docs Microsoft OneNote and Apple notes were not enough all the magic and enthusiasm the Grassroots Groundswell of support that Evernote once had has been 100 transferred to notion

###### 19

and to obsidian and once that magic's gone good luck getting it back now if you're curious what I just did is I was able to zoom in on a header so I could just have a little bit more of a focus concentrated view but we're going to go back up to the rest of the story okay away from the screen and I don't know if this will actually make the video but uh like Evernote right we all have a relationship with it most of us do and it's a painful thing to have to leave and feel like there's such a sunk cost and missed opportunity and what went wrong but you know so much went right and we have to be grateful for that now the real like the big reason that I left is because of privacy of formatting issues of all these things but the one that I haven't talked about that is actually kind of painful for me is um Evernote lost my information it lost two audios that I tried to record and uh they just they weren't regular audio recordings they were really important ones of uh of people who

###### 20

aren't around anymore in my life and and when I recorded that I thought it would save the recording but it didn't and so like I know I shouldn't the stuff happens right knowledge is it's a fragile thing like we think we saved something and it's there forever it's not there's so many different ways that we can lose information and knowledge and memories and a lot of what we're trying to do is hold on to the stuff that matters so dearly to us in the moment it seems like everything does but there's stuff that really does and those audio recordings that just did not save properly I mean I was burnt once I should have known

###### 21

better and I tried again and like we expected to be able to have something and and we didn't and I don't know so I don't want to hold that against Evernote that can happen with any software a lot of unknown variables happen probably should have had a backup recorder going at those those moments but um you know so that's again I don't know if I want to even put this in but it's just kind of the musings around Evernote and why we should be thankful for it but also why we should move on okay now I mentioned having a secret reason for getting you to switch and no again I don't get paid by obsidian or notion my secret reason is I believe that many of us need a hard reset on our toxic relationship with knowledge I mean like what if ideas just weren't a means to an end but wholly meaningful on their own ideas thinking like what if the journey was emphasized over the destination not in words but in actions every day by honoring the space that you think in developing there cultivating ideas experiencing the sense of intrinsic Joy within

###### 22

it do you know what happens then the hard stuff becomes easy I know because I have felt this you turn learning and creativity into an inherently joyful activity again Suddenly by trying half as hard you're producing more than ever and it's more meaningful than ever too and that's why I want you to consider the switch if nothing else to rough up old habits and to challenge them and stop capturing all the nonsense get your mouth off of the fire hose and just sit with your own thoughts can you imagine if you replaced all that noise out there with your own thoughts and interactions and insights and relationship building of different ideas I mean you'd have such a far healthier and sustainable relationship to knowledge I have felt this and that's why I make these videos that's why I'm spreading this message because we have such a harmful relationship to knowledge and it is easy to change it up I believe in our environment shapes us more than we realize even when we realize how much our environment shapes us and I will tell you this from 3 years of experience now obsidian is an environment

###### 23

that's going to shape you into a better thinker who has more joy doing that act that we do every day thinking itself I'm just curious though are you trying to be less of a collector and more of a Creator and if so how is that going like let me know in the comments below and if you want to stay connected take this portal with me to this video where I share why you might want to leave Evernote if you haven't seen that yet and how you can import your notes into obsidian so hopefully I will see you there now
