###### 1

why is it so hard to schedule time for ourselves we are so obligated to schedule time with others meetings Zoom calls appointments all of this stuff until it comes to us scheduling private uninterrupted time with you know who you that's what we want to get to and it is so powerful yet we don't do it and I have not done it for such a long time until just recently when I went on a 2 to 4 day personal Retreat it was supposed to be 2 days it ended up being 4 days and I'm so so thankful I took it but on that personal Retreat I want to talk about the first thing I did which was go through an Epic Wheel of Life template now this template will take you 2 hours you have to budget this time but on the flip side of these two hours you should be able to say something like this I know exactly where I am I know how I got here and I know where I would like to go I'm reading what I wrote and I hope you have a similar result so let's get into it

###### 2

and that template is a free download you can see it in the description below for you right now it works perfectly in the app obsidian I custom designed it to be the perfect Wheel of Life for an epic life audit it worked wonders for me that's why I'm excited to share it with you it is free you can just download it immediately and then you can actually walk through the rest of these exercises with me while going through the template or you can just watch the video first and then go through the template and you only need two things to do an Epic Wheel of Life audit you need a private place and a thinking space so make make sure you have a private place and then for me my thinking space will be obsidian the not making app and you'll find that this template works perfectly in obsidian but first what is the wheel of life it's a self assessment tool it's a way to know ourselves so what you do is you draw a little circle and then there are little pies where you look at how you're doing in health and wealth

###### 3

and happiness and these different categories you can slice them up any way you want and that's the thing about the Wheel of Life there's no one standard way and what you'll find in the Epic template that I've provided is that I've taken the wheel and just unrolled it so it's a bulleted list and why this is so important is because I've done wheel of lives from over a decade ago and I don't have those copies handy because I did them on paper somewhere and they didn't have any journaling to that what we have here is an intentional format that'll allow you to pull out your thoughts and visibly see them and then we'll see that

###### 4

how we roll up and synthesize and more deeply understand all that to get a really great perspective on where we are in life and where we'd like to go so without further Ado let's hop into the template okay now we're in now we're looking at the beautiful Epic Wheel of Life audit template and what you can see is a cool theme if you like this theme don't worry we'll have a video eventually the link will be up here and in the description below but let's get into actually how to prepare for going through this experience because there is just a little bit of preparation we want to do so again what will you need a private place and a thinking space this is our thinking space but you need to create your private place what is that going to be so you want to make sure you can budget 2 to three hours of private uninterrupted time it's really important if you're going to be distracted this isn't going to work for you how can you prepare beforehand I would say before you start this I mean feel free to just dive right into it

###### 5

I found it was helpful to kind of create some space in the days leading up just start thinking Loosely about how life is going for you where you are just generally speaking what what's gone well and maybe what where would you like to go the results that you'll say afterwards is is the thing that I said I hope you get the same result I know exactly where I am I know how I got here I know where I'd like to go and what you'll feel is that you'll be deeply knowing whatever it is you care about and how you want to move forward to have more of that in your life so here's how we're going to go through it we're not going to start from the top down all this stuff is going to from the bottom up so there are no scores to begin with we're going to start with a process called freew writing some of you have heard of it or if you don't want to write technology allows us to actually freely talk and dictate and see the words that we're speaking so we can really embody what we're saying

###### 6

speak from the heart and see the words so we can work with the words and develop and roll up these these words and paragraphs into deeper layers of understanding and that's where a lot of this magic happens now now if you don't have 2 to 3 hours that's fine what you can do is you can break this up now to let you know I did all this in 2 hours but let's imagine you don't even have that and you want just want to break it up into 30 minute chunks you can do that each 30 minute chunk will get you through one of the three major sections of the Wheel of Life review so if you only have 30 to 45 minutes you'll be perfectly fine all you need to do is just break up this whole activity into three different time blocks and then there you go something really important to note if you are opening up my template and you thrown it into obsidian it's going to have every header and bullet expanded unfolded twirled open and we want everything to start out collapsed so the way that you accomplish this is on

###### 7

a Mac you hit command p on Windows control p and all I'm going to type is fold all and then we have it fold all headings and list so I'm click that button and then you'll have this beautifully presented format and you'll be able to twirl open what you need and work as you go so that's the recommended way let's keep going so we've gone over the instructions and you can break this up into three time blocks as we've stated so now we're going to un twirl each of these sections so the first is the top section after 2 hours your final Reflections go here so we're not going to go here yet and we'll add a little score so we'll have some sort of number like 5.5 put that there at the end but we're not starting at the end so what we want to do is twirl down lived experience or relationships or work these are the three parts of the Wheel of Life review so choose the one that resonates the most with you we're just going to go ahead and start in lived experience so let me twirl that down and

###### 8

you'll see that within lived experience we have Recreation environment and body and then if we twir down Recreation we see that there are five in this case five subsections Hobbies travel leisure consum assuming and experiences like I said this is an Epic Wheel of Life audit this covers everything by the end of this you'll know all aspects of your life you won't have any like hey what did I miss what areas did I miss you won't have that you'll have confidence that you've covered all those aspects of life so that's Recreation we have environment environment is the physical environment the sensory experience and then what about our body sleep nutrition general movement and exercise so these are the things that we want to be looking at when it comes to lived experience this first section for this video we just don't have the time to walk through everything together but I want to show you how I would go through a few of these initial segments so this is all just in the lived experience section there are three sections relationships and work I won't droll those down just yet because I want to show

###### 9

you how I would go through this myself using hobbies and travel as the example so what you do is just click click on hobbies and then hit enter to create a new bullet and then indent by tab now we can start freew writing here and this is how you should approach it really freely punctuation doesn't matter grammar doesn't matter what matters is that you're getting it all out you're figuring out what are my hobbies what what do they look like what don't they look like and answering all the things in between so here's something that I can share because this one's not so personal um I don't have any hobbies right now that this is me answering truthfully during my personal retreat exercise is where my extra time seems to go briefly in this last quarter I was playing The Legend of Zelda breath of the wild and while that felt great I'm done with video games again at least for now I basically I for those that don't know um I started playing video games again after over a decade break and it was pretty cool for a couple months but I'm done with

###### 10

that that was a nice hobby but I don't need that anymore I just kind of want to go back to other other things although I learned a lot from Legend of Zelda breath of the wild that was amazing so this is all you do though you just create a little bullet like this now if you have another talking point you just go ahead you enter create a new bullet and then put whatever's on your mind there so you might do more freew writing or what I really like to do and you can do this simply like on a Mac I'm going to hit F5 which is this little audio button and your button might be in a different spot depending if you're on Windows or a different device uh but you can just dictate you can do this on your phone you can walk around and say whatever is on your mind for any of these subsections so this is what I did on my personal Retreat I was actually walking around with my laptop hit the dictate button and then I was walking around pacing around the room and I was just answering all

###### 11

of these that's how I was able to get through it in just two hours so something I ended up speaking out loud was this bullet the other hobby that doesn't really count would be listening to audiobooks it's clear to me that I should have some sort of hobby like dancing or something else that is physical but not just basic weight training or calisthenic type of exercise so this is me just doing a quick rundown of hobbies and I think I had a couple other bullets but then at the end of the day I'm just going to quickly say currently I'm going to rate myself as a four ideal it's not like I must have great hobbies so ideal is just a six whatever you feel like where I'm just going to use a scale from 1 to 10 we just want to quickly answer these you don't have to use numbers you could say uh the current is not much ideal having something you could say that but for now I'll just keep it with numbers and go 4 to six now this is crucial and there'll be another video on the rollup method or

###### 12

basically a pure emergence method of making sense of things what we call like rolling up information so what I'm going to do now is just collapse this and roll up all that text into just these scores so I can just see the highlight and then I'm going to roll down and get into travel so I'll do the same thing enter indent and then I'll start free writing or free talking right here and boom this was something that was part of my reflection I'm happy with my amount of travel recently but I'm less happy that some of the travel has forced me to become behind on things like the wow Workshop one of our private behind

###### 13

the scenes workshops all the prep and especially my uh book proposal so there's like a double-edged sword so when I rated myself here and this typically doesn't seem to happen but I gave my current rating an eight for travel but I actually want my deal to be a tick down a seven cuz I think I'm traveling too much and it's kind of caused more stress for all my other things that I want to do so I just gave that a score and then I collapsed that and then we go through everything so let's go ahead and imagine we gave these other subsections score so I'm thinking about my leisure time what do I do when I'm just relaxing what does that look like it might be similar to Hobbies but it is a little bit different what are you doing to relax to unwind when you're not really doing anything and then what about your consuming habits how are you engaging with content what does that look like what do you like about it what would you like to do differently so these are the questions that we're asking or variations of these questions for

###### 14

each of the subsections and then finally experiences when it comes to Recreation this big section what experiences am I having that I haven't already talked about what are those experiences what form are they taking what do I want more what type of experiences do I want more of so for all these subsections you'll have a score and then just kind of feel it out and overall all this will allow you to roll it up into a final score so I might say after all this that my current is a five and I'd like to get it to a six or maybe even a seven now along with this final rollup I'm going to go here and after finishing the subsections below I'm going to give an overall reasoning for my score so I'm rolling up I'm synthesizing I'm making sense of all of my free writing and all my free talking into the final summary and I'm going to write that here so my reasoning for this overall score is here and that's for recreation so then you repeat that process for environment for body and then once you're done with those subsections and sections

###### 15

it rolls up to give you a score for lived experience and again it's just more of a feeling you don't have to be completely accurate with your math so for my lived experience I think my overall score ended up being like a 6.5 which is not terribly high it's not terribly low um but I had ideas of what I wanted to do more of ideas of what I wanted to do less of and overall I felt really confident in how I wanted to proceed with living living my life okay now you know the workflow we twirl down a section like Recreation and then we answer all the subsections like hobbies and travel and then we roll up with scores and then we roll up with an overall score and takeaway and then we roll up even further to finish the lived experience section before we do that though I now want to walk you through all of the subsections with some priming questions after you have those questions and after you see all the subsections you'll have everything you need to to do the Epic Wheel of Life review on your own so let's get

###### 16

to it after Recreation we're going to twirl down environment so think about your lived experience so much of it is about the environment that surrounds us it's so much of our experience so in this one we want to review how we're feeling about our physical environment like think about where you are right now watching this is that a good place is it uncomfortable is it too comfortable just think about how you like that environment what about your work environment what about any other third or fourth places that you spend a lot of time in how are all these environments shaping you how is your town or city shaping you think about all of that and that's going to go into your physical environment so you're going to reflect on that here do your free writing or if you can I really prefer free talking for this exercise so hit that dictate button and when you do it this way as we'll learn in a different video on the rollup method you're able to do it in chunks so it's not like some dictation that you do for 15 minutes and you're like I never want

###### 17

to look at that thing again because I got a thousand words I have to run through when you do it in chunks like this it's all usable it's all clear and it all makes sense so you just go bit by bit free talk for about 50 words to 200 words and then go on to the next bullet so for example it might look about this long and then that's 50 words words and then go on to the next bullet and say your next point and so on and so forth so that's the physical environment but part of this lived experience of our environment is the sensory experience so think even further how are my senses like what am I reacting to are you in a loud environment is it a quiet environment is it um is it safe is it full of interruptions think about your sensory experience that you're currently going through day in and day out what do you like about it what could make it better so give yourself a current score and remember these current scores are not your aspirational scores this is where you think like how am I currently

###### 18

in alignment with where I think is ideal for me and then when you get to that ideal score think about what that would feel like so your current score is about alignment and not outcome so you can already be at a perfect current score and it might match your ideal score that doesn't mean you're exactly where you want to be in the end game of your life you're feeling alignment you're in a good place you're in a good environment and that goes for all of these sections and subsections so hey moving on from environment let's pretend that we went through this exercise we threw in all the text that we want to throw in and then we rolled up those scores then we're going to give ourselves the full takeaway where we made sense of all those bullets into one paragraph then we'll give ourselves a score here score here and then we can roll up and collapse environment we can roll up and collapse Recreation Let's Pretend environment was like a 5.5 and then we want it to be a six let's go over and twirl down body so here we want to think

###### 19

about sleep this one's pretty straightforward how am I sleeping could my sleep be better am I happy with the amount of sleep the quality of sleep then nutrition how is my diet am I eating at McDonald's every day how's that working out for me for those that know the documentary suiz me Morgan Spurlock actually just passed away at the age of 53 I believe and uh and part of that was probably not related to McDonald's but maybe part of it was from that experience who knows point being we should be mindful of our nutrition then we have movement how am I moving around generally speaking and movement is a different section than exercise why is that because exercise is more intentional it's more active movement though can just be how am I having healthy habits throughout the day that distinction is important for for many of us working out in the world and it's important to have just because you exercise for 30 minutes or 20 minutes even at one point of the day if the rest of your day you're stuck in a chair and you're not moving at all that's something that we

###### 20

want to bring attention towards that's why we have that separate bullet for you to work through so let's pretend you work through all those then you controll that one up maybe you gave it a final score and you said well actually the body could be a lot better there it's a four I want to make it a seven So based on all of these that you've twirled from the bottom up rolling up all this knowledge layering in your understanding as you go for the lived experience section for this category you can give it your score and maybe I say it's a six again it's just kind of what I think my current score is and then that's going to roll up again to this overall assessment at the top now before we get to that overall assessment that's the final end of the rainbow so we're not there yet now I can actually collapse lived experience so it's just a single line all that work is now collapsed into a single line let's quickly go through relationships and work I just want to give you a few priming questions so that you can go through

###### 21

this you can follow along with me kind of use me to kind of prime your responses or just go through it immediately and then afterwards when you have the time you can go through the whole Epic Wheel of Life review on your own terms all right so first let's start with the soul the soul what is the soul let's not go into definitions right now but let's answer these two subsections what do you feel how do you feel you're doing with your life purpose if any of you have read the book The Alchemist that's called the personal Legend what is this thing that you're just drawn to that is your personal legend that your heart is calling you towards maybe this is just general personal Discovery whatever it is go ahead hit enter hit indent and start free writing or free talking same thing spirituality whatever that means to you there should be some component of it in your life and if you say that there shouldn't be a component in your life just give it a low score and then you'll have that as a data point maybe 5 years later you feel like

###### 22

maybe something's missing maybe there's something you can add from spirituality I don't want to preach or tell you what to do it's just something that we should consider it's an element of life however we engage with it is important to note so you do your work there you can then roll those up and then we're done with soul we can give Soul a score let's say hey we're at a six there but we want to be more of a seven if I know for sure I'm at the end of life I'm going to say I really need to bump this thing up I need to get my Affairs in order just a consideration let's go into partnership that's going to mean something different for all of us but what I want to stress here is that there's some sort of intimacy or closeness how are we doing in our life with intimacy and with closeness so you could have a lifelong partner but you might not be intimate or close at all or you might not have that partner but you might feel in your relationships in your life you are very intimate and close

###### 23

with these individual uals you're able to be vulnerable so whatever that means for you now there is another section on romance depending on where you are and and what resonates with you you'll just want to know where you're at the score is just reflective of that it's auditing where you are in life and how that might affect how you feel and where you might want to go and then last let's not forget fun and lightness romance can be pretty serious and intense sometimes but where's the fun and the lightness when it comes to our relationships want to make sure that we have a category that we can reflect on so that's why that's there now let's pretend we're done with partnership now we have family and friends so let's twirl down family two categories I want to look at one is family connection how are we feeling connected with whatever we call family now for most of us that will actually be blood family but it doesn't have to be it can be whatever whoever we think of as family and how is that Family Health now what I mean by health is kind of

###### 24

twofold one is how is the actual Health like the physical health of everyone but how is the emotional health these are about relationships so what can we do with relationships to strengthen that health so maybe there hasn't been a family reunion in a while or maybe you weren't at the last three like myself well I'll be going in uh tomorrow to celebrate um an annual family reunion with my extended family so I definitely have put some emphasis on this and want to take advantage of that and let's not forget friends now the friends category you can see that as you live longer and longer in life um you might find the need to partition out how you think of friends so for me and what I think will resonate with a lot of different people and different ranges of life is that you have close friends you have old friends who sometimes are close but not but they're still important you still want to like make space with them and think about how you're maintaining or not maintaining relationships there because remember this whole category is about relationships so then with friends we we also

###### 25

have we also have community and social connections so uh some social connections might be work related if you go into the office those are social connections um or the broader Community might be your neighbors or just other social groups you're a part of and then there's this fourth one that will be interesting to some of you here friends that are protoy so protoy is a Greek word that meant first among equals so it's just a nice way to say all friends matter all people matter but there are certain friends that you might for whatever reason wherever you are in life they're the protoy they're kind of like the first among equals so we don't have

###### 26

to say who they are exactly they will always change but how are you doing with those relationships those friends that you cherish so much that you want to really make sure that they have a a special space they might not always be close friends and that's why we have a separate space for that they might not always be old friends that's why we have this fourth space where we can analyze all of that congratulations if you've made it this far you have finished at least the priming and prompting for the relationships section so let's imagine we score all these and at the end of the day we say I've been working really hard personally um and that's been at the sacrifice of my relationships so maybe my relationships are five now we're going to continue to roll up all this information and collapse that to a single single line lived experience six relationships five we have one more big section to go through and that is work so with work we have three subsections and that's going to be uh work itself finances and then in this Epic Wheel of Life review we're throwing in

###### 27

the mind here the mind kind of goes everywhere so we're just throwing in the mind at the very end it's the last thing we're going to look at so if I twir down work there are four subsections here first with work is your career or business health and trajectory so let's look at those together how are you doing there how do you feel about your career Health how about its trajectory what can you do to improve it um what does it look like how can you strengthen it and be happier about it in the next one we cover a term called protoy relationships so what's interesting is in relationships in friends we have friends that are protoy but this category first among equals is so important it also flavors work relationships so you might have those people in work that are first among equals but let's analyze them separately because they're not always friends they're not always in that same ballpark and so I do find that this distinction is helpful for me to recognize that there are certain relationships that I do want to cultivate and nurture in my career but I don't necessarily

###### 28

want to think of those relationships as friends we should be okay with that we should be comfortable with that we should create a space so we can think about that differently so that's what we're doing here and then the third one how is my creation or production like how am I creating things doing things in work that have actual outputs um that people can see and measure how is that looking if you're a content creator that's maybe creating a new video if you're in the office and you're working on spreadsheets that might just be completing a spreadsheet or updating a spreadsheet it could be a million different things but how are you feeling in your creation process or in your production process that's what we look at there productivity comes into into place there and then last sense of contribution we can be really productive we can know that we are targeting the right people in our career we can have a good health and trajectory but how do we feel about our sense of contribution is this filling us up extremely important that we understand how we can improve this score in whatever our

###### 29

work situation looks like all right let's pretend we got through that two more to go so find finances of course we have to cover finances we can't pretend that finances are not part of an overall holistic Wheel of Life experience so with finances we're going to look at net worth whatever your net worth is however you're going to calculate it put something down on paper because now you have something to compare future you towards and if you've done it before you can compare current youu to past you and this can give you a sense of where you are and can allow you something really valuable Clarity and you can do stuff with Clarity but if you don't have that Clarity what are you going to do so that's what we're doing with net worth and then tied into work is cash flow you know what does your monthly cash flow look like uh are you happy with that most people aren't always happy they they want to improve these things well what does it look like to improve what's realistic uh what's the time frame for that type of improvement and then third what's your

###### 30

sense of control and confidence in your finances so you'll have worth you'll have some cash flow coming in whatever that looks like but how much control or confidence do you have in where you are and where you would like to go and then last the Mind almost saving the best for last depending on who you are how's my sense of learning do I feel like I'm learning new things then second category what how's my sense of sense making so we can be exposed to a lot of stuff we can be feeding our curiosity but if we take it a little bit further then that's when it becomes the sense making so how am I making sense in my world am I spending extra time reflecting on conversations I've had or trying to like connect ideas to other ideas or how am I you know growing in knowledge and hopefully wisdom that's what we're trying to understand here and that does tie into but it's slightly different than a sense of personal growth do I feel like I'm growing as a person as a human being what is where's my sense of that like I can

###### 31

tell you when I'm buried in my work and I'm just turning out the next thing I might might be learning I might be sense making but I might not necessarily feel that I'm tied into a sense of personal growth so there you have it those are all the prompting questions so based on all these let's give ourselves a work score and uh you know I probably score quite High there these days too high so uh let's give work a score of eight so now I twirled that up I rolled up all of this this is a method of starting from the bottom and rolling up every time that we roll up information we're deepening and layering our understanding and it's giving us more confident where we are and where we would like to go so based on all these I'm going to type out my final Reflections here as I'm articulating what really stood out to me what you want to do here is give your reasoning for your overall score what really stood out to you out of all this and you'll usually feel it multiple times as you're going through this you might

###### 32

unexpectedly be talking about all sorts of things that you didn't even know that's something that we'll cover in the hidden takeaways the stuff that this bubbles up that this reflection bubbles up but at the end of the day you'll put in your final Reflections here and you'll give yourself the overall score so I think my overall score was is it like a 5.5 or a 6.5 which feels fairly low but I'm about to say why it was the most beautiful thing ever and if you're following along with me this is a great time to hit pause fill in your answers now and then when you're ready hit play again okay wow if you've gone through all this walkthrough so far I'm glad you're still here because there are some really important takeaways and I want to share with you a sneak peek into some of my final reasonings for my overall score so now me personally my score after this 2hour really intense assessment was 5.5 and you might think oh I should be upset with that or disappointed quite the opposite so I actually wanted to share with you my exact my exact um

###### 33

takeaways so 2 hours later you can put in your final Reflections and let me just twirl down what you see on screen is what I wrote with a little bit redacted but let me just read this out loud it's funny as I look at the score 5.5 which kind of seems alarming I'm leaving this entire exercise feeling okay with myself in my current trajectory and this is because the exercise helped me gain even more clarity by articulating answers for each these unique lenses while redacted redacted redacted the exercise has given me relief in its clear conclusions and that leaves me feeling good even understanding that my current score is 5.5 and then I go further in a different bullet because that was good chunk and now this a different topic if I never do another wheel life again and you can tell it's not capitalized so I was dictating this that's fine because I've dictated and written over 4600 words it'll all be okay because this single exercise has helped Propel me to the the next phase of my life's Quest so you could tell I'm I'm kind of poetic there I'm feeling pretty pumped

###### 34

with a 5.5 score like how Wild is that so I'm going to share a next action and takeway from this too because that's what you'll want to get to but before we even get there there's a hidden little header at the very bottom of this template and I want to share that with you now because it's really important as you look at your score and make sense of it be kind to yourself so if you click this call out be kind to yourself and the best way you can do that is by being honest that's the best way you can be kind to yourself because the hidden benefit isn't some stupid score some number it's the hidden emotions and the deeper understandings that this exercise will Bubble Up out of you it's the clarity and confidence that the exercise creates so this is truly one of those times where it's not the destination it's the journey and if you go through this journey you'll be so happy with the destination even if you score 5.5 or less so again it's not about a number it's not about the score it's about being kind to yourself

###### 35
