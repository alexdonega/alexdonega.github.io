Obsidian is not just another app to compare features with. Yeah, it's a thought acceleration machine - very cool! Yes, it's a tool for thought, broadly speaking. Yes, you can use it as a commonplace book, but it's so much more. But if there's one thing you can expect from me, it's not to dwell and focus on "what an app is," but to focus on the "why" and "how" of making meaningful notes, because that's what the true value is for you. So, while my beginner's guide to Obsidian (free on YouTube) shows you what Obsidian is and how to use it, it never loses sight of why you would want to use it in the first place. Like Pat Riley of the Miami Heat, it keeps "first things first": what Obsidian is, as cool as that is, matters far less than why you would want to use it. I share my reasons in the video called "Why Make Notes," but I'm curious: why do you want to make notes? Please let me know in the comments below. And as always, stay connected. [Music] You
