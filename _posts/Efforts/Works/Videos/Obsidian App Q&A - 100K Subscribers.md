whoa this really blows me away we hit 100,000 subscribers I never thought that this was an actual possibility back in 2020 I just wanted to help people manage their thoughts and ideas that's why I'm so grateful for each and every one of you for watching for subscribing and engaging in all these videos and if you're new here my name is Nick Milo and this is linking your thinking and we talk about how to get our thoughts in order make meaningful notes and be become prolific at whatever matters most to us all right I think that's good okay a lot of you have shared tons of thought-provoking questions in the comments of our previous videos and

###### 2

it's been a bit of a challenge to keep up with all them so to celebrate 100K 100,000 subscribers I'm going to answer just over 20 of your questions so thanks for subscribing and here we go okay from 12 cablo thanks for the video unrelated question do you meditate now I I have a weird relationship with meditating I find that the more I talk about it the less I actually do it usually being socially accountable helps to well stay accountable but it doesn't seem to work with meditation because even if you keep your streak going it starts to feel performative and once meditation becomes like this performative thing then is it really meditation I don't know something to meditate on all right this next one is from dust Le fog can you give tips for how to write notes about others stuff while making it your own this is like at the center of my wheelhouse so yes I can give tips you're basically asking how can I stop just taking notes and actually start making notes and here's really the simplest way when you find yourself saying that's interesting or you know something captures your

###### 3

attention what you need to do then is capture that spark in a note that's step one capture the spark in a note and then just remember this r and R that stands for remark and relate so to make a remark just finish this prompt that's interesting because whatever you say next that's what you type that's interesting because and just start typing now that will finish the first R of remark now for the second R of relate that's where we want to make a relationship so all you need to do then is with that note just link the idea there to another idea and you just need a finish this prompt that relates to that relates to blank and then just finish that and bonus points if you actually link to another note because then you will be linking your thinking in a visible way you will have made your thoughts visible and that is a really powerful thing so good luck to you dust Le fog now before I get to the third question I have a small favor to ask from you I just looked and realized almost 72% of people that watch my

###### 4

channel haven't subscribed I I believe we can get that down to 70 in the next month or so my ultimate goal is 50 so if you've ever liked any of the videos I've posted if you like this channel can you do me a quick favor and hit the Subscribe button it helps this channel more than you know and the bigger the channel gets as you've seen the more videos I can do so thank you okay this question from Stefan Hansen how can I automatically remove the inline square brackets from these markdown files um if I later want to turn a bunch of my notes into a piece of writing so here's a great example let me just go ahead and on screen I'm going to open up concept map of content Moc and so what Stefan's talking about here is these notes here now if I actually copy it we're going to get these brackets and that's not very pretty if we have to copy and paste and and share this with someone so what you'll want to do is simply go to the three dots and go into reading mode so this is basically

###### 5

a preview of how everything will look now what you'll just do then is copy from here so now I'll just copy this and then I can go into a different document hit paste and we won't get those brackets so that's that's my ideal way to go about this process and actually we can take this one further and here's what you'll need to do so I opened up an application where I can paste that text just to show you and if you hit normal paste it's going to look pretty pretty messy over here where we have the links so if you don't know this already you'll be glad to know this afterwards there's another way to paste and I want you to hold down this is a handful literally is shift option command V basically when you paste like that or if you're on a Windows I think it would be shift alt contrl V that will allow you to remove the formatting and have your formatting match the environment that you are in so when when we have links and everything it will strip the links and you'll get this clean nice copy like you

###### 6

see on screen all right thank you Stefon next up is Sage one thing I find hard to do is to come back to notes I've created how do you accomplish that well the first thing I want to ask is what if you never went back to them then what would life still go on it probably would how does going back to them actually help you now these might seem like silly questions you you just say it's obvious I want to go back but can you explain why and if you can explain why then we can figure out how to actually set it up properly so I'll explain to you why I want to go back to notes so I can develop ideas that mean something to me okay so then what do I do well in my home note and this is all part of idea verse for obsidian and you can find a link to download this in the description below but I'll just add something and then later on I'll go back to this I'll add a new note however I do that in fact we can add one together so I can

###### 7

say answering questions is good for all okay so this my new note but then I get pulled away into some other activity and that is closed so then all I need to do is go to add and this will pull the recent notes that I've been working on so that's what I do as I'll just go here you can see I've been demoing a lot of things so there's some silly Untitled notes but there are other Notes too that I intend to work on and organize and so that's how I go about that process and then later on I go to the next part of the arc framework that's add relate communicate so then I'll go to relate and like okay what notes do I need to relate oh I need to connect these boat notes they're just floating by themselves oh I want to develop these notes let me jump into it and start to develop it so that is where I recognize my major use case is about flowing ideas through this Arc framework and that's just add relate communicate how ideas move through space and time and I've set up my notes

###### 8

to allow me to do just that so I can go add relate communicate all right great next up Daniel Graham has a question are publish notes searchable online hey so let's find out I'm going to go onto this place called the light kit and this is uh notes. linking yourth thinking.com I've put this up and what I'll see here is yeah looks like I can search Pages or headings so great example that might be if I type intro I can see that intro is actually a heading for a couple different notes so I can click on this one and I can go immediately to a heading called intro and that's buried pretty deeply within a note called the five decade rule so that means right now in obsidian publish you can't search text across all of your notes but you can search uh note names what they're calling pages here and headers okay Mino has a question can I have a custom URL so it turns into a Blog yes absolutely in this example as you can see if I keep this open this URL is actually just at the core notes. linkyou thinking.com because

###### 9

I made it that so that's a custom URL you can certainly make your obsidian publish your blog okay here's a question from Alchemist bite would you recommend obsidian for writing a novel yes and no I mean it depends so on one side of the coin you have someone like PD Workman an award-winning and us today best-selling author who has written over 100 books and I think half of those have been written entirely in obsidian and then you have lonel davo an award-winning French author who does all of his thinking his story building and His World building in obsidian and then writes the draft in scrier so it really depends on you what's your use case but you certainly can write everything in obsidian since this is a celebration video we're giving away three handcrafted desktop idea verse wallpapers this design is meant to evoke the joy and wonder of wandering around your idea verse the place where all your thoughts are connected and for those of you lucky enough to have read the little prins this book here you may notice that we were inspired by it in the design these wallpapers are free and

###### 10

immediately downloadable at the wallpapers Link in the description below I hope you enjoy and please let me know which is your favorite is it the blue one the purple one or the green one I'd like to know all right here's a question wow this is fantastic man what community theme are you using thanks for making this thank you for asking I use two themes these days I have my my own theme called lyt mode and I have Damen quartz's theme prism what you see on screen now is prism because it's a cleaner clear and more orderly theme for whenever I want to share my screen but I do love light mode so hey let's just check out lyt mode right now let's go to its preferred theme which is in the dark mode and you can just see how everything pops it's really standing out but again since I upkeep it it's always a little bit behind the curve things don't always look as nice as some of the more established themes do and that's why I just stick with prism and keep it in light mode and then I know it can both work

###### 11

for me and it can work with everyone else that I share idea verse with okay here's a question from Armageddon Afterparty what is the hotkey for enlarging the entirety of obsidian okay so that is just on a Mac command plus or command minus I use this all the time um if you're on Windows I think think you can do Control Plus or control minus I might be wrong on that one but on the Mac for sure it's command and um command plus and command minus here's a question from Steph out of curiosity what are you using for task management I've tried all the big ones but I've landed on doist which I love for tasks and quick notes okay so as many of you might know I spend most of my time with knowledge and ideas and a little bit into efforts and things I want to to accomplish I don't spend as much time managing tasks that being said I spend some time managing tasks so where does that happen well for the most part it happens in an app called things things it's clean it's beautiful it's simple it works and it works

###### 12

on all devices so things really is the front runner there however there is another app I do want to mention and give a shout out to and that's called not plan now as of this recording note plan is only on the Mac but very soon there will be a Cloud solution so then you'll be able to use it anywhere the reason I like it so much though is that it is naturally local and naturally markdown so that means just like obsidian is local and markdown so is not plan if obsidian is where I'm going to have my ideas my joyful thoughts the knowledge that I'm creating and working and managing with then I can use not plan for tasks for efforts that I and here's the beauty about it too is you can actually link from one to the other and that's the beauty of many of these apps nowadays is that each note that you're in I'll show you an obsidian I can click on these three dots and I can copy an obsidian URL and I can throw that into not plan so I can connect efforts that way where that works and

###### 13

where I use it right now are on a few of these efforts like IDE verse Pro which as of this recording is coming out in a few weeks I can track the overall part of the effort here and I can work on it here but then I go over to no plan when I want to make sure that I can manage the tasks and make sure things are getting done plan out schedule all that stuff now again I'm not a heavy task management person but when I do manage tasks I use things and a little bit of note plan and maybe in the future it'll be more note plan and just things as sort of a quick capture because it's really good at just capturing a quick thing okay here's a question I am a novel writer who is receiving helpful critiques from other writers I would like to gather all the critiques and have them available for my revisions what would be a good way to organize this now here's what I would do first make sure you have an effort hub for the novel any of these are my effort hubs for different

###### 14

efforts I'm working on I can click on that and then I can link out to any sort of note anywhere else I can add notes so what I would do is I I would create a single note to begin with and I would copy and paste every single critique so this might be a pretty long note and then based on all that content I'd make a bulleted list and I would surface that at the top of the note so in my critique note I'd have the bulleted list of things of notes I actually want to address and I would make sure that that's open in a note window over here and then I would have

###### 15

my actual novel on the right hand side with my critiques over here so that's how I would do that and wow we are actually rapidly approaching 200,000 subscribers that means I'd love to do another Q&A like this one but this time I want to be more of an AMA is that cool with you like ask me anything whether it's hey what's your guilty pleasure or what YouTuber would you like to collaborate with or do you have a team do you manage everything by yourself or what's an Insider story you have from working on the 34 time Emy awardwinning show better call all please share your question questions in the comments below we'll compile all those and pretty soon we'll have it or ask me anything video just for you okay here's another question hi Nick is there any hotkey that I can use to turn selected text into a link yes it's actually easier than you think so let me just open a new note and we'll keep it Untitled and I'm going to throw in some Latin text and imagine I select this text and I want to make it a new link it's

###### 16

not even a hotkey all you have to hit now is the left bracket twice bracket bracket and immediately it's a placeholder note and if I click on it it has become a note that's all you have to do it's that simple but let's take it further if you want to link to a URL there's a super Nifty plugin called paste URL into selection and this really helps so let's imagine that you go to the link in your thinking website and you copy that URL now if I go back over to this laurum ipsum text I can highlight any of this and instead of normally you would hit command V or control+v to do a normal paste with this plugin I'm going to hit command option V and boom what do we have now this is actually kind of cool to point out as well we have the link right here and you know it's an external link because it has this little box with an arrow pointing out pretty nice internal natural note links and then external URL links it all can happen right here okay our next question is from ryak how do you

###### 17

display or toggle the local graph all right so this is actually there are two ways you can do this the first if you don't have my IDE verse you can always hit command P or control p on Windows and start to type local and then immediately you can hit the return or enter button and it will open up that simple but let's close that and pretend that we have it mapped out because we've downloaded this awesome idea verse Pro kit or the IDE verse for obsidian it's right here I've hotkeyed this to something now what would you hotkey it as if the global graph is command G well maybe the local graph could be something similar like command option G right so that's what I can hit here and boom we get the same result everything that's con connected to home in a local graph and then of course we have all sorts of ways we can filter this down but we're not going to look into that right now okay here's our next question how can I use toggles like in notion are there any shortcuts for this well actually it's not a shortcut

###### 18

it's a setting so if you want the toggle options and what we're talking about here are these little toggles isn't that pretty cool I can oh and look at that I can toggle down even further so how are we accomplishing that so what you'll want to do is go to settings so let's let's just go ahead and click on this Cog wheel and for this to happen we want to go to editor and then you'll find it right here fold heading and while we're here let's make sure we also have toggled on fold indent so you can see they're both toggled on and because they are we have this cool thing that when we hover over we can figure out that we can collapse this header I can figure out I can collapse this now if something's already collapsed then you'll see the toggle and it's right there ready for you so I use these a lot as you can see right here this was a sens making session from the current Workshop we actually just did this last week and this is how you can fold headings and indents okay the next question from

###### 19

muhamad is there a way to see all the existing obsidian hotkeys yes there is the best way to do this is once again let's go to settings and there is another core option place called hot keys and this is actually a evolved and become quite good so there are a couple ways that you can filter out results but let's imagine you're wondering if you can make a hotkey using command G so if you click that little keyboard button now I can press the hotkey I have in mind I hit it and we see oh wait command G on a Mac is already mapped to open graph view so that's one way that you can just do that immediately out of the box so I can just click this x to go back to all these settings and the other way that you can go about it is if you don't know the hotkey but you know maybe the name like sidebar let's say I can start typing sidebar and I can see what options exist for sidebar okay now if you want to go even further and really that's enough but there is a cool

###### 20

thirdparty plug-in and it's called keyboard analyzer and I'm going to look for keyboard it looks like I don't have it installed but that's okay here it is keyboard analyzer so let's go ahead and install this and just kind of see what it looks like I'm going to click enable and might as well just click on hotkeys and okay this is telling me that it's a command so it's not mapped to any hotkey but that's fine I can hit command P or contrl p on Windows and then I'm going to was it keyboard oh there it is I hit enter and now look at this this is pretty cool now I can hit G and I can see all the hotkeys that involve G this is pretty cool right like we can actually see what about a looks like navigate back for me z um oh here we are R now we see that there three there what about e this is pretty cool this is a cool view definitely when you really want to map out everything you could use keyboard analyzer for those of you who really want to sink your teeth into things

###### 21

but honestly um hotkeys is really all I need these days here's the next question not sure if you answer this later but do tagging and linking work across vaults or are they limited by The Vault that you're in and so the way to think about this is just so we're on the same page what you're looking on screen right now is an obsidian Vault but what is it really it's a folder that just exists on my computer somewhere and I open it up in obsidian naturally it becomes a vault so I can have as many vaults as I have folders on my computer and most of us only need one Vault but imagine you have more than one and you want to link between them how does that work well first this vault is self-contained so if I open up a separate vault which is a different folder on my computer they're they're they will not be able to interact and they shouldn't be able to interact that would be weird but that being said if you took a note from Vault number two and let's imagine it was linked to this home note and

###### 22

you just drag and dropped it into this idea verse that link would automatically be recognized as being connected to the the home this home note so they would automatically link so that's an interesting kind of thing and I've had this happen personally because I have a lot of stuff going on in my idea verse including the version that you see which is actually a nested folder within my core idea verse here's the next question from Terren do you have any suggestions on how to keep track of the tags that we have created yeah if you're using obsidian it is pretty easy these days there's just a folder just make sure that we go go to settings and we're going to go to core plugins and just go down to tags and make sure that you have tags view activated once you do that it'll likely show up in your right hand sidebar and then these are your tags even further with tags you can Nest them so under note I have these other subtags like my boat notes these are these notes that I want to link to other notes and that's how you can

###### 23

easily manage your tags okay this is from Nick great name one thing that is still a bit unclear for me is when tags are useful or in what cases they can be used all right so that's going to tie into this next question as well so thank you for that Nick and this is from react again not sure what is the point of tags though if links can already connect notes together why do you need tags and you might not but there are many reasons to have tags we cannot explore them all I want to focus on how tags make searching for things easier especially as you get more notes now here's a great example I could have a link to a note called notebo and then a different note created called note develop a different note created called note question and I could link to them and it would look ugly because note question isn't a fun thing to look at or I could use tags and this is so easy to search with all I have to do if I want to see these boat notes is click on the tag and all

###### 24

the results populate over here this goes further too for for anyone who has been with the program for a while they might want to add a saved search we can also call that a quiry so these boat notes I actually have this ready to go for me right here that means I don't even have to have my sidebars open I don't even have to look at my tags they're working for me because all the boat notes are coming in right here for me to work on that's all through tags now we we don't have to use tags we could use other bits of metadata of what obsidian now is calling properties but tags work really well as do properties where links it just get kind of messy you could make it work but it's not necessarily the best way to use it so hopefully you can maybe see that there are some use cases for tags and it's perfectly fine if you don't have any use case for right now don't try to force it just wait for that moment where you feel like I kind of have a problem I want to see all

###### 25

all these type of notes and I'm having a difficulty making that work just through links you probably have ran into a situation that might benefit from a tag or a different piece of obsidian property metadata all right next question from Ricardo hello I'm new to obsidian and I'm loving working with it I have just one question I've looked and I haven't found a way to password protect a file is there any easy way to do this okay you're in luck already obsidian is end to end and encrypted so you're good you're good for everyone the 99.9999999% of people in the world you might be asking well I actually want to encrypt from the people who might physically have access to my device if that's the case you still have a solution there is a thirdparty plugin and it's called meld encrypt so we can see that here and we can see what it does uh create encrypted notes within your obsidian Vault so so hide secrets in your Vault so you can go ahead and experiment with that you'll have to set a password remember your password of course or you'll won't be able to

###### 26

ever get into that note again but this is a way to do it and it looks like it's been vetted by 48,000 different downloads so if you really need encryption you can give that a try wow that's 21 I believe 21 questions that have been answered from your comments from previous YouTube videos thank you so much for sending them so if you've made it this far I appreciate you for spending your time with me today I hope you find my answers have been helpful for you and if this type of video content resonates with you consider hitting that like button and subscribing to this Channel and feel free to watch this next it's my free course on how to manage your whole life with the idea verse for obsidian and until next time stay connected
