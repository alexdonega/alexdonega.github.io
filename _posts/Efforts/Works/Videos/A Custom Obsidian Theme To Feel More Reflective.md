imagine your favorite place to read a book maybe it's at your local library if you still go to libraries or maybe it's at your place by the window think about how that feels as you cozy up in that spot with your book in hand that's the feeling I get every time when I open this theme in obsidian our environment shapes us more than we realize even when we realize how much our environment shapes us that's why I care so much about putting intention into my thinking spaces and one of my prominent thinking spaces these days is the app obsidian I want to make sure when I enter it it activates something within me so I can be my best self so I can realize my fullest potential of thoughts and creativity the way that I do that is by changing themes and today's theme is not technical it's not sterile it's not like we're staring into the white abyss of Google docs no this theme is warm cozy inviting it invites and evokes a certain sense of creativity in me it's like almost writing on paper like you're writing for the New York Times and

I want to show you how we get there but first let's dig a little bit deeper into why we might change a theme we're not changing the theme of our calendar apps usually so why change the theme of our thinking apps and well the answer is kind of there it's so we can think in certain ways differently because our environment shapes us if we change the theme we can actually change how we're thinking so I have three major themes that I work on and this is is my new favorite and the theme that we're going to install together we're calling it code name soft paper because that's what it feels like to be in this environment and that's the beauty of obsidian it gives you this blank canvas where you can create your own thinking environments now it does take a little bit of tinkering every now and then and I've done the tinkering for you and now we get to go through it together so let's finally begin so now on screen you can see I have open one of my obsidian vaults this is actually the free idea verse for obsidian Vault you

###### 3

can download it it's in the description below and the reason we're using this one as an example is because it's coming pre-baked with a few folders in here and once we install the new soft paper theme you'll really see how the folders come alive so this is just a nice demo Vault it puts us all on the same page and I have a few different notes open so we can see how the new theme will look all right so here's how we want to begin whatever obsidian Vault you have open whether it's idea verse or whether it's your own or your own idea verse let's go down to the settings icon and it's right here and what we're going to do is start by going to appearance and then manage so once we hit manage what we want to do is type Anu poin I don't know why it's called that your guess is as good as mine we're going to hit install and use so immediately we see this theme now this isn't the theme um you know how it starts out isn't what we would call soft paper but it's still Pleasant so

###### 4

what we're going to do is hit the x button and now what we're in appearance the first thing I want to let you know is that you we can change the base color scheme light and dark while both themes work well with soft paper we're going to focus on the light theme so just make sure you have light theme activated there now the next thing we need to do is install a plugin style settings so let's go over to community plugins we'll hit browse and we'll start to type style oh looks like I already have it installed it's already a part of idea verse so click on that and then either install enable when you're ready go ahead this button will now say options so once it says options we can go click on that and it opened up the style settings options and just so you know it is now in your sidebar of community plugins so I'll scroll down I'll find it and I have a few different style settings I can control but we're now going to toggle open twirl open the anap puchin settings so we can just toggle back and

###### 5

forth and get that nice little pallet animation opening up excellent but don't worry you don't have to touch any of these settings because I've already done the work for you so we can go ahead and collapse the anap puchin settings all you need to do is go ahead and click this import button all right so now this is where we're going to import from a link and you can find that link in the description below and it's going to open up a Google Document so on my screen which I have opened for us right now that will lead us to this page let me make it a little bit bigger for everyone these are the light an aoin style settings for soft paper so what you can do is hit edit and select all or hit Commander control a and then we can hit edit again and hit copy or Commander control C so now with all these settings copied we simply go back to obsidian and we just paste so we go ahead and hit paste now I'll hit save and let's look at what happens ready and boom now we have soft paper

###### 6

installed so we have the home note I'm just going to click around so we can get a sense of how it looks and isn't this beautiful hey we're not done yet there are a couple other things that we need to do and for those wondering where this theme came from I have to give full credit to a Reddit article that will'll link in the description below and so that redditor took the anap poin theme and customized it in a way that's very similar to this then upon being inspired by that I took it and made some f fin tweaks to my liking made sure all the settings are ready to go and that's what you're seeing on screen but we're not done yet and what we're about to do is going to turn soft paper into even softer paper because right now we still have a Sans serif font now almost everything theme in obsidian works best with a Sans Sera font so that is a non-stylized you can check out this H here it's just really harsh all the lettering is really harsh it's highly readable it's highly effective and and efficient but in

###### 7

soft paper we finally have an option to write like we're reading an article in the New York Times or the Washington Post or one of these fairly Timeless types of Publications and the way we get there is by installing a font I'm going to walk you through this font install together so don't worry if you haven't installed a font before I'm going to show you how to do that on the Mac and don't worry it's a completely free font it's actually called New York so we'll see how we get that installed and let's get to it so just follow along with me I'm going to go over to my internet browser and type something into a search field like apple developer fonts and then you'll find this website fonts for Apple platforms uh we'll have a link to that in the description below as well and I'm going to scroll down until I finally find New York and this is what we're going to install together so go ahead find New York click on that download click allow or whatever the button is and then we're going to install this together so I'll go ahead

###### 8

and click on my downloads I'll double click on the file I'll see it's here I'm going to hit install and then we're going to go through this process we might speed up through this so you don't have to worry about all the different steps but you can see I'm just making sure I'm installing this properly and making sure that it goes through yada yada yada okay so the font is now installed we sped through the install process and now I'm going to click back into obsidian now check out the font look closely at it because it's a about to change and we're going to get the full soft paper effect so now that we have New York installed what we're going to do is simply close we're going to quit out of obsidian so we can reopen it so I can get rid of this I think we're basically done with our internet browser so let me go ahead and reopen obsidian from the side and boom New York now we have it now we have the theme as it's intended our soft paper theme this is one of the three them I work in

###### 9

I'll cover the other two themes in different videos but I spend the most of my time in this creative reflective theme that we're calling soft paper now how beautiful does this look let's just walk through what's going on so we have rainbow folders on the left and I think I want to add one more folder so let me go ahead and just call this one X so we're using the ace folder framework that is part of the idea verse kit and we're adding this x folder for extras and you can see how we maintain this rainbow look you can see when notes are outside of the folders how they appear we have a stylish ribbon which you can hide in your settings if you want to we can always collapse as needed so we have this beautiful writing space and so you can see it has this almost card-like feel so not only is it a soft paperlike experience we have a sarap font as opposed to a sand sah font it is one of the few themes that allows for sarif fonts to work so we have those two things going for it and

###### 10

then the third thing is we've made a card-like format that again brings us back to the analog so we can really sink down into the experience of thinking and writing in a more tactile and slower way now if we were in a completely white background look so if we take it back to prism prism is going to be efficient it's going to be effective and it's going to be a Swiss army knife it'll meet you wherever you are but when we want to sink down and be a little bit more cont lative maybe a little bit more reflective creative whatever it is now what I do is I go to the anap puchin theme with these settings applied to give us the soft paper look now the other one that I will do I mentioned the three themes so we have prism when I want efficiency we have anap puchin soft paper theme when I want to be more reflective and creative and then we have my very own light mode lyt mode theme for that one I make sure I go in dark mode and this is when I want be both creative and

###### 11

just kind of In the Zone on something in a wildly creative expansive way so those are the three themes I use so you can see with lyt mode what some of these notes look like and then when we go back over to their anap puchin soft paper this is dark mode by the way so even the Dark theme with anap poochin kind of works it's a little bit more intense that's why I like to take it back over to the light mode and we can see how that looks here okay so here's what you can do in this theme I mentioned it's really good to slow things down and think things through so what you can see now is I just threw in a note to the Epic Wheel of Life review so in a previous video that we'll have linked to here we go over how to go through this Epic Wheel of Life review and this is the theme that you want to do a review in when you're doing an annual review when you're doing a un review whatever type of review you're doing in this case The Wheel of Life review

###### 12

I think you'll get a lot of mileage out of switching to anap pin's soft paper theme I mean just look at how beautiful this is just scrolling through these different sections that you can fill in at your leisure as you go through a reflective slightly creative process all right a couple fast considerations if you choose to use this awesome Theme by anap puchin with the soft paper overlay that we're providing so if you go over to settings by clicking on the Cog icon scroll back down to style settings and if for whatever reason you want to revert the anap poochin settings you can just go ahead and click this button to reset all settings to default and if you want to bring back the soft paper settings then just go ahead make sure you copy and paste that file that you'll find Linked In the description in that Google doc then go ahead and hit import and make sure that you paste the new import settings there boom they're back another benefit of being able to switch themes is to switch context as I like to say our environment shapes us even more than we

###### 13

realize so in this case we can help our environment shape the way that we're Thinking by changing themes so yes for different vaults of mine I have different themes then I know immediately at a glance which Vault I'm jumping into and it allows me to then go Full Speed Ahead in that context without any delay that's really underrated so if you're somebody that has multiple vaults I do encourage you to kind of think about what theme is best in this situation and which theme is best in this different vault so as we wind down this video I'm really curious if you use anap pin's soft paper theme and how the experience is for you definitely let me know in the comments below and even more than that what themes are you using so I showed you a few themes of mine including this brand new one with all the install instructions hopefully you get it working but what other themes really make you come alive also just really fast I want to celebrate how amazing it is that we can do this in a tool like obsidian where we can customize our thinking spaces hey

###### 14

let's get something straight we're all on the screen on our digital devices too much so at the very least if we can find a way to make it more enjoyable and to make it more clear what type of mental space we want to be in all the better and we can do that in beautiful themes whether we want to be retro80s um expansively creative like in the lyt mode theme whether we want to be efficient effective and clear-minded like in the idea versus main prism theme or if we want to settle down into into an environment that's a little bit more tactile a little bit calmer still creative still evocative and something where we can reflect maybe that's the time that we turn to anap puchin with this soft paper style setting applied now I'd love to hear from you how is this theme working for you and when do you choose to use it more than anything I hope that this theme can bring more joy into your not making and thinking efforts now if you want to know what I think you should do with this theme is to do some sort of

###### 15

reflection or how about an Epic Wheel of Life review because if that's the case here's the video for you and it will walk you through the entire process about how to take stock of where you are in life and how to get more clarity both where you've been where you are and where you want to go so again that video is here hope to see you there and until next time stay connected [Music]
