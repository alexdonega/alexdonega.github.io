if you are tired of getting overwhelmed with information or losing momentum on your personal and professional efforts then linking your thinking might be your missing piece to the puzzle today we will cover how and why you should link your thinking you will learn how to do it and why it works you will hopefully see and feel how your own idea verse can grow over time if a healthy idea verse is a well-connected thinking environment guess what linking notes together will help you create an idea verse to get there we are going to re-enter idea verse for obsidian which is the world's most downloaded starter kit for Linked notes now this time as we step into the idea verse we're going to act like a child stepping into a Sandbox we're going to be curious we're going to be open to wonder and we are going to be ready to play that's how you will truly unlock the power of linking your thinking you ready okay let's go all right we are now inside the idea verse at its simplest level idea verse for obsidian is just a folder with 250 files but those 250 files

###### 2

let's just call them notes they point to each other over 1,000 times let's call each one of those points a link so what we have here are 250 notes that are linked 1,000 times and once you get to that many links your ideas start to behave like a living breathing ecosystem like a forest a planet or even a universe that's why it's called an idea verse now let's do the thing what's the thing making links so let's jump into any old note or let's create a note actually so I'm going to just go here hit the plus icon and then create a new file now let's uh for now just call it just start so this is the title name I'm going to hit tab now I can start typing here's what I'd like you to do hit left bracket twice bracket bracket what that does is basically open up end endless portals across the idea verse that you can hyper jump to that's right pretend you're a space pilot and the IDE verse is yours to navigate the only limits are your imagination but if you want another limit just start typing anything let's

###### 3

type the word start what do we notice there's this note called start here so let's go ahead and click that and we have just created a link now I'm going to hold down command or control on Windows as I click on this link it opens into a new tab that way and I want you to notice that below the note there are linked mentions and what is pointing to this note aha it's just start the note that we just created okay now let's jump back to just start I kind of want a stronger Title by the way did you know you're allowed to change what you title your notes It's actually an amazing form of sense making and in tool tools like obsidian every connected note will update the link let me show you what I mean so here we have just start now I'll go back to the note called start here and you see this linked mention now when I go to just start let's give it a stronger title how about something like a journey of a th000 miles starts with a single step cool and now I know that's by uh

###### 4

laa so I'm just going to put that there for now and then we'll have that that I can come to later let's jump back into the note start here and see what happens okay cool so now in the linked mentions notice it automatically updates so when you have links that are connected all over the place if you change a note title those changes percolate and you don't even have to do anything this is part of the moment in 2020 when link thinking broke the sound barrier we went from mock Z .9 to mock one and boom this is an amazing superpower I can't wait for you to experience it okay let's go back to a journey of a th000 miles starts with a single step this is a great note and maybe the notion of all those steps make me think of a connection when something is repeated a bunch what does it become that's right a habit okay so let's start typing so I'm going to hit what am I going to hit left bracket left bracket or just bracket bracket and I'm going to limit our search This Time by typing habit and

###### 5

immediately you can see all these hyper targeted results the one that I'd like to actually link to is habits map isn't that great now we have a link an always available portal to another area in the idea verse or in Plaine we have a file in that file we created a link to another file that's cool by itself yay we can easily link notes but it's what that does that make people fall in in love with linking basically you think better learn faster and remember more any of those benefits would be worth it but all three this is really unfair by linking your thinking you are habitualized yourself to think more critically more creatively and connectively not to mention you will generate more unique thoughts than you ever have before how might these superpowers be useful to you my goodness let me count the ways now one neat thing about link notes is a practice that I advocated for in the spring of 2020 where you add a link to the top of a note if you can believe it today this super Common Sense practice was initially met with like a lot of push

###### 6

back from a very dogmatic part of this zetel Casten Community zedel Caston is German for slip box and it essentially is all about Atomic notes the problem with all these tiny notes is that you get lost in a forest of them this is why in the next lesson we're going to cover maps of content which is the solution to the the mental squeeze point when you get overwhelmed by too much information all we need to do is make a map we throw links on that map and life feels pretty great now we can solve that problem now we can make those insights and now we can return to something when we're ready for it but let's go back to the value of having a link at the top of the note not only does it help you navigate but it helps you make sense of things let's do an example I'm now going to jump into that habits map note and you'll notice at the top there's a related note called the three phases of maps of content or moc's but we're not going to go there right now instead I'm just going to look

###### 7

around at this awesome map that I developed it might not mean a lot to you but it means everything to me because I used this note to make sense of a topic this topic happened to be about habits a topic like habits connects to all sorts of other topics that are interrelated in a really interesting way for now let's just jump into defining a habit we can look through all this and this is great isn't it now we might just dive into it and start exploring so if I'm in this note for whatever reason I might decide to then jump into let's say feedback loop okay so now I'm in feedback loop life's going well and then I say well it is related how habits okay habits carry a ton of hidden inertia I'm having a great time but let's say for whatever reason my mind feels like I could use a bit more structure like I hopped from note to note to note great I maybe like tweaked a little bit of notes here and there I made some insights but I'm feeling like a little overwhelmed and I want some structure basically I

###### 8

want to be able to zoom out so here's what we can do with that top link that I was talking about at the top of this note you'll see it goes up to the habits map so all these kind of micro notes are likely going to be connected to a macro note so I go back to the habits map now without even moving my cursor notice that it's already hovering over over another link this time it's not necessarily up but it's related so now I can just go ahead and click on the three phases of M's and again if I hit without even moving my mouse if I click again it'll go to the moc's overview what if I click it again idea verse map what if I click it again well then it's going to go to home whoa what just happened we're flying across the IDE verse as fast as we can click and many but not all roads will lead you home home this is a knowledge Network and each year imagine having this your idea verse becomes more valuable to you it's as much a secret weapon in self- knowledge as

###### 9

it is in career advancement and I know because I've used it for both several times but I won't bore you with those details right now instead let's hop back a little bit because I just want to talk about these metadata values so here if we look at moc's overview which we'll overview tomorrow let me let me go ahead and add a missing related link that I think would make a lot of sense here how about the three oh there it is the three phases of maps of content so let's look at this what is happening because I can't go over all this stuff at the top of these notes but I should at least give you some context so you know what's happening this stuff is usually called metadata it's data about the note that you're looking at now in obsidian this metadata can be easily managed in this section called properties and there are endless bits of data that you might want to track let's imagine that you're into movies maybe you want to create your own IMDb database and you want to have some category called year and then you can say the

###### 10

year that that movie came out was 1990 and then after a while you can have all those movies grouped together in a really interesting way oh wait have we shown this already so quickly I can open up sources map and we can see what we did with books how they're categorized by year what what does that look like let's click into the count ofon Christo whoa look at that year 1984 and what's above it up and related that's what we were just talking about so let's go back to moc's overview and just finish off this conversation on metadata here's a quick word of caution before I share my basic strategy don't overdo it don't feel obligated to add a bunch of stuff here don't spend more time in properties than you do in the content itself so here's my simple recommendation for almost every note you want something that is bound by relatedness and something that is bound by time that is if you want to greatly improve the odds of you being able to find this note when you want to find it and if you want to find it in context to all

###### 11

the other important notes and if you want to improve your comprehension in the process okay here's my pneumonic for metadata related and created have one of each so in this case we have two relationships one that points up and then one that is just generally related and then we have a created date now if it's a movie I might put year instead those are going to be some nuances that we'll cover elsewhere we might cover that in the workshop those sort of places but essentially you want related and created so if we look at this note we can see we have a related and created and if I feel like I don't actually need that area go ahead and delete it you can do that at the end of the day if you want to remember this for the reasons we just talked about related and created that's the only metadata you need everything else is gravy on top when you really get into your specific use cases and then that's cool too now for a deeper dive as to why this works just remember stir stir stir stands for space time importance and relatedness

###### 12

and you can go ahead and explore it further by opening a note called you stir to remember more and you can read about it all here it's pretty cool but that's enough metadata for now can you start to see why so many people get excited about linking their thinking I navigated around my notes effortlessly if I wanted to write an article in habits I was already off to a good start and all my related material was already a click away but even if I never write a single article to the outside world my work here has changed my inner world as it helps me make better sense of all the world around me and you can have all this power for yourself what's cool is that when I leave this idea verse behind I take this idea verse with me how profound is that the links that I make in the digital idea verse directly affect the neuronal links in my inner idea verse in my mind and this fascinating interplay between the technological and the biological connections has a really neat result it subtly flavors every future decision every future choice and improves the

###### 13

the chances that it will be better richer and a more fulfilling outcome you simply must start linking your thinking it's both practical and Priceless now in the final lesson for this introduction to the idea verse you will learn two major parts of linking your thinking the first is how to have quality stuff to link to in the first place that's where we cover note making instead of note taking and the second is how to overcome these mental squeeze points that we have so we can supercharge our thinking that's where we use use maps of content so when you're ready click here to jump to the next session and we'll see you in the next one
