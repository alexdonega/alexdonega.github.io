"Why is it so hard to schedule time for ourselves? We are so obligated to schedule time with others: meetings, Zoom calls, appointments. All this stuff until it comes to scheduling private, uninterrupted time withâ€¦you know, who? You. That's what we want to get to, and it is so powerful, yet we don't do it. I haven't done it for such a long time until just recently when I went on a 2 to 4 day personal retreat. "But on that personal retreat, I want to talk about the first thing I did, which was go through an Epic Wheel of Life template. Now, this template will take you 2 hours; you have to budget this time. But on the flip side of these two hours, you should be able to say something like this: 'I know exactly where I am, I know how I got here, and I know where I would like to go.'"
