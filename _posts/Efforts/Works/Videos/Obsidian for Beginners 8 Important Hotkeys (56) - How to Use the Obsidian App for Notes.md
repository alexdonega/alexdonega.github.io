"Isn't it frustrating when the tools you use can't keep up with how fast you're thinking? One solution to this is the use of keyboard hotkeys. I use them all the time in the internet browser and different apps that I use. It really takes your thinking to a faster speed. Now, when it comes to apps like Obsidian, knowing the most important hotkeys can really take your thinking to the next level. Just as a reminder, I'm Nick Milo, and this is 'Linking Your Thinking,' where we talk about the how and why of making meaningful notes. This is one of the final videos in our series on the basics of using the note-making app Obsidian. Let's dive in. Okay, I'm excited to jump into the hotkeys. So, let's create a new note using a hotkey - I'll tell you that one later - and let's call this 'The Eight Most Important Hotkeys in Obsidian.' I'm only showing you three now, but you will see the other ones. So, the first one is 'Open Link.' While you're in edit mode, you've seen me do this already, and it's a command-click on the link. I think, on a Windows, it's

control. I'll be speaking in terms of the Mac operating system, so keep that in mind. So, let's find a note - and we're in edit mode, right? Because we can see this hash. Now, if we get out of edit mode - which we'll cover - then we don't see the hash anymore. We're back in edit mode. So, if I just click on this note, it's like I'm trying to edit it. But once I hit command and then I click, boom - it opens the note. I use this all the time. It's super, super powerful once you start thinking in terms of these links. You need to be able to use this hotkey. So, that's a command-click. So, where's another one? 'Adversity Paradox.' Command-press command and click, boom - we're there. Okay, let's now - I'm looking on the side - and let's go to the next one. So, number two: 'Toggle Preview.' This is edit mode; this is preview mode. How am I getting there? I'm hitting command-e. What's really nice is this allows you to be a left-handed ninja. You just keep your left hand right on the keyboard, hold down command, and you

can toggle back and forth. When you're in preview mode, as you might expect, it looks nicer, but you can't edit. When you're in edit mode, you see the behind-the-scenes formatting of markdown, and you can edit. So, that's number two. Number three: 'Open the Quick Switcher.' Once you do want to start typing, bring that right hand off of the mouse and hit command-o. And that opens up the quick switcher. Then you can start typing whatever word comes to mind. I'm thinking 'note star,' but I can't remember it. So, I was like 'note' and then 'n-o-s' for whatever reason, and then 'ooh' - note star. I hit enter, boom - we get taken to the note. So, that is another extremely valuable hotkey. Let's throw in the next three: boom - number four - 'Search.' This is command-shift-f. See what happens here. It takes us to this new pane. We were at file explorer, but when I hit command-shift-f, I just start typing. In this case, I'm going to type in 'for never,' and I can see the two notes populate immediately. Maybe I want to search for a hashtag, so then I go 'concept,' and I

have these three concepts. I can see it was used twice in this in this note - one here and one here. Very cool. That's repeat - don't need that - and let's go back now. Next hotkey: okay, so you start navigating around and just like an internet browser, sometimes you want to navigate backwards. So, there's actually a hotkey for that. Obsidian is a pretty advanced app, so instead of wasting real estate with big back and forward buttons - which will probably be some sort of plug-in later if you really want - instead, the way to do that is to use a hotkey. In this case, it's command-option left arrow - left arrow - left arrow - left - left - left - left. And it just takes me back - back - back. Same thing: command-option right takes me forward. And that's number six. Two more to go. Can you see how just a few hotkeys can really take your game to that next level? Final two: new note - remember we were just going to new note? We started this video series on new note. Well, if you can imagine it's command-n. That creates

a new note. So, I just hit command-n and I just start typing, and that's the title immediately. It can be whatever you'd like it to be. Then you hit the tab button and then just keep typing in the title. So, that's pretty nice. How am I going to get back to that old note? I hit back - boom - I'm back. And last, this kind of opens up a whole new window of functionality. So, we're just hinting at it. Is that we can open a note in a new window? So, what does that look like? Not a brand new window but a new pane. So, we command-click on a node - so, remember, when we were in edit mode, if we command-clicked on a link, it opened that note in this pane - but if we command-click over here on a node, let's see what happens. Command-click on this node - it opens a new pane - and these might be a little tight. So, in case you weren't aware, you can find the edges and drag these however you need to so you can see them. Now, we have two windows, and remember, what

###### 6

I can do to see preview mode? I can toggle that with command-e here. Is me toggling preview mode again. Now, let's say maybe I don't want to look at 'Red Pill Blue Pill.' So, what I'm going to do is quick switcher - what was that command-o - and I type 'adverse.' Oh, there it is - and I hit enter - and I'm at the 'Adversity Paradox.' So, hopefully, you can see just how powerful this application is, especially once you know the markdown, especially when you know a few basic settings, and especially especially when you have a few hotkeys at your disposal. So, if you like this video and you haven't already, please subscribe below and especially in this video, please comment below. I mean, these are just eight hotkeys. I'm sure if you have any experience with Obsidian, you may have found your own hotkeys that you really, really enjoy, and I'd love to see what those are below. So, please comment down there. And I hope you've been enjoying these videos. Guess what? We're on to the very last video. I'll see you in the next one. You."
