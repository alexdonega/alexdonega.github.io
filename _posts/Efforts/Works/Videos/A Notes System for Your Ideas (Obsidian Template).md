"What would it feel like to have all your ideas available to you reliably at any time?" That's the promise of an "ideaverse" - a place where all your knowledge is connected, where your ideas go to live, and where they power and support your mind and the actions you take in the world around you. Imagine how much calmer and more confident you could feel in your thoughts and actions, imagine how much clarity you could gain, and imagine how much more effective you could be in all of your efforts. Here's how we get there: _ Have a home note that centers your mind and launches your thinking. _ Have a space and system to develop ideas. _ Have a way to reliably return to your own knowledge and your favorite thoughts. _ Have a space and system to capture new sparks. _ Focus your day and reflect on your direction. _ Have a space and system to intuitively manage your efforts. Learn how these three spaces match the three headspaces of personal knowledge management: _ The "Atlas" headspace for knowledge. _ The "Calendar" headspace for time. \* The "Efforts" headspace for action. Experience the clear context switch

each space provides. Learn how three core folders match these three headspaces for a unified system. Learn how to customize the core system to meet your personal needs. Learn why "ACE" works: _ See how efforts beat projects because projects simply don't work as well with ideas. _ See how the four intensities of efforts help you effortlessly manage your entire life. _ See how to overcome information anxiety with maps of content. _ Learn how to use maps of content not just to index information, but to catalyze your thinking and to generate some of your most inspired work. \* Learn how maps of content help you navigate your ideas. Learn how to make notes, not just take them, and how making notes creates a habit that creates value for you and through all this, feel how linking your thinking works to support and empower your mind and the actions you take in the world around you. Now, let me take you through a quick walkthrough of what you can expect from the "Ideaverse" for Obsidian. What you can see on screen now is that I'm super zoomed in to the home note and the "Ideaverse" map. Think of

the home note as your dashboard, but it's really a place that whenever you're lost, you can go back to. It's also like a launch pad; it can launch you into whatever effort or idea or inspiration that you might have at any given time. The home note is built around three different headspaces: _ The "Atlas" headspace for knowledge. _ The "Calendar" headspace for time. \* The "Efforts" headspace for action. These headspaces encompass anything we might want to do with ideas. Under "Atlas," you can see places that you can go and different ideas that you might want to develop through our other framework, "Arc," "Add," "Relate," and "Communicate." No matter what you're doing in whatever industry, profession, interest, hobby, or enthusiasm that you might have, you're going to go through an ideation process of "Arc." You'll be adding things, relating them, and communicating them. In the "Calendar," you can quickly capture a spark in a new daily note. You can review old notes, and you can plan future ideas. It's all happening in a calendar of time. When we get to the actions, we control "Efforts." I can't wait to go into this in more depth; I

think efforts and the four intensities are a huge game-changer. Notice the unified feeling of the Ideaverse. It is mirrored in the folder system. Even if it's a folder or even if it's a link-based system, we can still use the unified Ace folder system, the framing system. It's an orienting system for three headspaces: knowledge, time, and efforts. In addition to the Ideaverse for Obsidian, you will learn how to customize your personal Ideaverse, how linking your thinking actually works, how to make notes not just take them, how to use maps of content, how to build your own home note, how to customize Ace for your particular headspace, and how to use efforts instead of projects. The Ideaverse empowers you in unexpected ways and encourages a sense of creativity and connectivity, exploration, and wander. It helps you balance action and reflection and achieve a robust ability to move through life effectively and joyfully.

You can really fine-tune and customize this for yourself and leave with your own custom Ideaverse, all of this for free at your fingertips. An

Ideaverse isn't only about productivity; it's about PKM, which stands for personal knowledge management. The world of knowledge and ideas is complex, and narrow-minded, white-knuckled self-shamers out there are on a one-way route to burnout. We'd like to think the path we take is linear, but it's not. It curves, swerves, hops, and skips. If our thinking is fragile and not agile, we might march headfirst into a ditch, especially with how fluid the modern world has become. This is where an Ideaverse empowers you in unexpected ways that other people only call luck. While it can help you be extremely prolific, an Ideaverse also encourages a sense of creativity and connectivity, exploration, and wander. It was once said quite well in a book from J.R.R. Tolkien that not all those who wander are lost. Now more than ever, those who wander are those who win life's long game because they balance action and reflection and, in the process, achieve a robust ability to move through life effectively and joyfully. That is the power of an Ideaverse, and you can have your own. Good luck getting it started. Stay connected, and we'll see you on the inside once you download
