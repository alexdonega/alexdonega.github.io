"If PKM could utter a single line, it would be this: 'Through me, you make sense of the world—that's fundamentally important, because through your sense of the world, all your actions are influenced. That means, through better sense-making, you become empowered to create, to learn faster, to work at a higher and more sustainable level, and yet stay grounded and focused as the world attempts to tear your attention apart. Through better sense-making, by digitally linking your thinking, you can develop your ideas over decades. You can make more valuable leaps of insights, and all the while, you can't help but train yourself into the habit of better thinking. By better thinking, I mean the ability to think critically, creatively, and connectively—all at the same time.'"
