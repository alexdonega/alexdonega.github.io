Kate Bush's song, "Running up that hill," was originally released in 1985 and it resonated with a lot of people. However, it didn't climb to number one on the charts. In fact, in the wide arc of 80s music, Kate Bush was not on most people's lists of favorite artists. Sure, the people who had good taste she was on those lists, but not on mine. I consider myself a lover of random 80s pop music songs, but we all have blind spots. Before Kate Bush could even write and perform her song, she had to be inspired. She had to live in the world and experience it. Her song is what emerged from mixing her uniqueness with her personal experiences. Now, for the rest of us, her song became something we could experience ourselves, something we could grasp. It became an artifact, an object of our attention, and it could inspire us. In this case, idea emergence was the process of a song emerging from nothingness into somethingness through the artistic expression of one, Kate Bush.
