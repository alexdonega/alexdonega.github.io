###### 1

Have you ever tried to copy text out of Microsoft Word or Evernote, or even email and it comes out as a bunch of unusable gobbledygook? Have you ever tried a shiny new writing app for maybe a couple weeks or a month thinking you'll use it forever. But then a couple months later, you know that you're not and then your writing is kind of stuck there and you have trouble getting it out. Writing in markdown solves this problem. It might look intimidating with hash and Asterix symbols, but I promise you there are only six keys that you need to know to be writing like a pro with the confidence that your best ideas are not trapped in somebody else's program. Let's dive in. Okay, so let's begin. First thing I'm going to do is hit that button, the new note button, and this creates a new note we can title at the top I'm going to paste in the six most important keys to typing in markdown. I'll paste it again in here. Now I know you're thinking it bold or italic, write? Well, no, maybe in traditional text editing in Word, we would think bold,

and we would think italic. But in personal knowledge management, we need to think how to connect ideas, we need to think about how to link your thinking, without a mind, we've already discovered the most important part of markdown, which is the link and that's where we hit bracket, bracket. And then all of a sudden, we have this list of our notes. You know, programs like Obsidian are really smart. So if I type No, these are the notes that remain. And if I hit s, there's an S and note star, then I have to hit enter, boom, now we have that link. That's pretty wild, right? What's cool about this, if we go back to graph view, we now see the six most important keys to type in a markdown connected to note star, right? That should look familiar by now. So let's go back to this. That is the link super powerful. The thing about the link is it is a strong direct connection. But that's not the only type of relationship That we can build between ideas and not feeling tight that we want to make the other one and number two, when dealing

with markdown is the tag. So a good example of this is I'm looking at my note library. And I see a couple concepts in here. So let's, let's try using the tag. Let's use at hashtag concept, okay? And I see the adversity paradox. And I'm just going to at the bottom, just put in concept and look at autocompleted for me, and I also want to put in concept to red pill, blue pill. So at the bottom, I'm just going to go and hit C, and Enter. Now we have that. So how does this work? So if I Command click on concept, we get to search. We'll cover this in detail in the next video. But you can see right away that those three notes Give me the results because they have the tag concept in them. We can do all sorts of things with these results. But the most important thing to know right now is that's how tags work. Okay, now we've covered the link we've covered tags. Now let's get into how to make our text look a little bit prettier. And let's start with italics. So now we're getting into this aspect.

And so what happens is it talents typically you want to emphasize something so as you're typing and you want to emphasize something. Do you add Asterix? And there you have it. So we can see that we have metalex in this section. How did that happen? markdown reads these Asterix to single Asterix like that to give you a tallix. Now let's take that to the next level. The number four most important key to working in markdown. You got it. It's bold. So how do we do this? so bold is typically typically I will use this when I want to bring attention to big nouns. And what do we do to get bold in this case, double Asterix on both sides. And that gives us big nouns. Excellent. Now, we're almost there. Now we're going to get into the formatting and cover lists. So we've been making a list. Now what's that look like? If I hit dash, hyphen, and space, then I've created a list. And what I'm going to do now is delete so then I can enter and solve We're like obsidian is smart enough to know that a list is began. So now

###### 5

when I do this, I'm starting to make my list and it naturally for me. So now we have formed a really cool list. And that's how it's done. And the sixth and final thing that we want to do to get a handle on markdown is to understand how to use headers. So let's go through the notes and explore this a little bit. It's actually hashtag, but then you hit the spacebar. This gives us that title. And there are six levels of this. 5:28 So let's explore in some of these other notes, adversity paradox. I usually like to have that here. So I'm going to hit hashtag, and then adversity paradox. Doesn't that look pretty nice already. And let's imagine we wanted to hit related here and make this something new. So we hit three hashtags, and look at that. It's smaller, it's a header three header levels go from one all the way down to six. Let's see other examples. As we're printing up our notes, this is the Evernote kind of redundant, but we put it right there. Same thing with note star. See how quickly this can go after a while, I'm going

to paste, what I'm doing is I hit the hashtag, and boom, pasting in the title related. Okay, so you remember how to do that previously, this time I want related to be the header three. So now we have something that looks pretty nice. And sure I could go header four, five, and six, and we see that they're kind of all the same size at that point. This is to this takes us back to header one, which is the title, but I think three is kind of nice sub header in this position. The matrix we didn't put in so you can see how fast you can start to format your text. And remember you don't want to stay focused on this but it doesn't hurt Viktor Frankl No, I might add what's, uh, what's a perfect tag for a person? You know, it'd be that people tag. So I'm coming back through these notes, I'm trying to make them pretty, you know, here, I might put in movie, I would this, I'm going to put in PKM, you need to put these tags, not necessarily. But you see how easy it is, as you're going in

and out of your personal knowledge management library, you can simply add a couple things here and there, and just incrementally improve your ideas. And the beauty that we'll touch on later is that when you get these touches, what you're really doing is you're getting reps, you're getting repetitions, and every rep that you get does something up here, it allows those neurons to connect a little bit easier, a little bit more efficiently. And that's what allows us to remember and recall even better, so yeah, we just go through and we kind of improve the notes as we go. What's note star. For the sake of it, we'll just say that note star is under the people tag. And now that I have a few, I can click this one and see that we have never known note star and Viktor Frankl. So that's another way that we can kind of use those weak relationship builders tags to our benefit. Now this is one list. And finally, we're going to change these up, which is a tiny bit of formatting. But you can see that this is an auto numbering list as well. So this is another

form of the same thing. And here we have it, the six most important keys to typing in markdown. The final note I want to make on this that's really important is there's no formatting bar at the top. Why is that? It's because for text that we create, the most important thing is the idea that we have that we want to get on page that we can externalize that we can articulate that we can put in into a place that we can then return to and grow. So formatting is out of the way and we can focus on the most important value creating activity, which is actually thinking writing out those ideas and expanding those thoughts. I hope you found this video useful. See markdown really isn't that intimidating. If you have these six keys at your disposal, you'll be off to the races and writing fast and efficiently just like your mind works.
