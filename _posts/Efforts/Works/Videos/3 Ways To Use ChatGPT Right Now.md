Welcome to the world's first artificially intelligent operating system. Hi. So how can I help you? Oh, it's just more than everything just feels disorganized. So you mind if I look through your hard drive? Okay. That's really weird. You'll get used to it. Everyone's talking about a new chatbot called Chat GPT. I don't know if you use this chat bots. But it is insane. It's a beta. It's incomplete software. But it's already amazing. And it's very useful. Right now, in this fast video, I'll show you three ways that you can use it not just to think for you, but to help you think better. Hi, I'm Nick Milo, and I'm here to help you do your best thinking more often. Why? So you can make meaningful stuff that you're actually proud to put your name on? Alright, let's go first. If you don't have chat, GPT, head down to the show notes and follow the directions to get it. What is chat GPT it is an AI Chatbot. You ask it questions. It answers them. It can translate into all languages. It knows all coding languages. It can even generate rhyming poetry. It's kind of like

Siri, but I didn't get that. Could you try again, it works. And here's how I'm already using it. First, split your screen, put your text editor for me that's obsidian on the right and chat GPT on the left or arranger Windows however you'd like. But you want chat GPT right there riding shotgun with you. And I suspect this will be a common way for us to work in the future with the trusty AI chat bot by our side. Now the main thing chat GPT can do for you is to be your little research assistant. Now I know what you're thinking, Well, isn't that what Google's for? Yeah, it works fine. But chat GPT is already better, it's often quicker and easier, because it does a bit of the tedious work for you. Now, let me explain. I wanted to know the story of Don Quixote. So here's the search engine way off to Google, I go search for Don Quixote, then I have to decide what I want to read out of that whole list. Now, often, Wikipedia is a good choice. But that's job number one, you have to decide what to read, then

I have to read it and figure out its meaning. that's job number two. And what you get on Wikipedia varies a lot. Sometimes you can just read the first paragraph. Other times like this, you've got to go deeper into the article. At this point, I could go back to Google and read a different article, in which case, I've wasted time with the first article. And now I'm just rolling the dice that the next article will be better with chat GPT, these two jobs, they're gone. I just asked it to tell me the story of Don Quixote, and I got this paragraph. And that's all I need. With a single question. I got what I wanted AI like chat GPT can help inform you. Next up, I want to know which character came first, is it Don Quixote or Shakespeare's character Hamlet. Now this task is a little different from the first one, job number one, I need to Google Don Quixote and find out when it was written job number two, I need to Google Hamlet and figure out when it was written, then I can decide which one came first. Now instead of this

bit of boring legwork, I asked chat GPT, which came first, and it just told me done, and then I can copy and paste from here, and then I'll throw that into my note on Don Quixote. So actually, let me take off the privacy glasses. And then with this question, whose greatest work came first, and then paste it right here. And it's as easy as doing a little bit of magic. And then right away, we know that, guess who wrote this chat? GPT we have a question and an answer. It's beautiful. And as part of my note on Don Quixote, that can grow with me and connect to other ideas, as I keep thinking and creating works that are meaningful to me. Now, if you're curious how I made this little box, I cover call outs and obsidian flight school 2.0, when to use them and best practices for making them an effortless part of your thinking process. Now they are that for me, they finally clicked and now I can really use these to allow other people's thoughts in this case, other bots, thoughts, stand out from my own thoughts. Now compare this to your

Google results. Google can't do logic, it can't make any sort of assessment. Even something as simple as this. Which story came first? Ai like chat GPT can do research for you. But that's not even my favorite reason for using chat. GPT but quick one. If you want deeper dives into how you can leverage AI to help you think better and create more meaningful work. Make sure to sign up for my newsletter below. Now onto my favorite point. It gets even better chat GPT helps you think better, you have to use it to fully feel what I mean. But it helps you think more clearly about what you are trying to communicate, it forces you to be an active, engaged thinker. Why? Because you have to ask the right questions. For example, let's go back after I asked about the story of Don Quixote, I got a response from earlier, and I realized I cared less about the plot, I wanted to know why I should care about Don Quixote in the first place. So I typed that in, and this is what we got. And then if I want to keep it in my note

on Don Quixote, I can just go ahead, paste it in here, put it into a little call out box. So I know it came from my trusty astromech droid chat GPT. And this, this is the good stuff. This is why two years ago, I chose to start Don Quixote, and why after just finishing it, I'm so glad that I did a I like chat GPT can actually help you think better, big, big, big, huge warning, chat. GPT is not yet trustworthy. I cannot overstate this, it will tell you things that are false. This is a known issue, so be careful. But in many cases, like in these examples, I already know some of the basics. I really just want confirmation and a bit of extra detail. And what I got back here is consistent with what I already know, these answers are good enough. Again, a eyes are notorious for making stuff up. If you ask chat, GPT anything high stakes, be sure to confirm it. To recap AI like chat GPT is already extremely useful. And there is no reason not to be using it right now. It can inform you it can do
