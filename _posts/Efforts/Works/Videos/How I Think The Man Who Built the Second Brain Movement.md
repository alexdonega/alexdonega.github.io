if you think of the world as your teacher just ask yourself what message does it seem to be trying to get me to understand Thiago Forte Thiago forteo Forte he is an internationally recognized speaker productivity expert world's foremost experts on productivity author of building a second brain building a second brain building a second brain a proven method to organize your Digital Life and unlock your creative potential all the knowledge is basically free and universally accessible now either through Google or chat GPT or whatever what is not universally accessible and never will be as my life experience imagine if you were to talk to this alien and you were to tell them your problem they would be so far removed the only thing that you would have in common if you think about it is like the laws of physics that they would understand and not much else in an alternate reality where ever note disappeared tomorrow where would you go welcome to how I think I'm your host Nick Milo it's easy to see what someone writes or what they share but I'm interested in exploring how they think how does the sausage gets made

###### 2

yes we'll explore the creative process but we'll also explore someone's unique perspectives and see who influence them along the way my guest today is the very amazing Thiago Forte Thiago is a very generous person you may know him as the founder of forte Labs the creator of building a second brain the author of the bestselling book with the same name along with his latest book the par method he's also become a friend over the past year and a half and our conversations on Knowledge Management and everything in between have been epically rewarding that's why I'm thrilled to have him on today to learn more about how his first brain actually ticks how are you doing I'm good I'm so excited to be here I'm excited to have you I think everyone knows how much you've put out there how much you've shared but we only every now and then get a taste of how you think mhm and that's what I really want to explore today and from what I understand we have 10 special questions that we'll be covering some of your favorite questions so before we get into that I do want to

###### 3

start off with just a little bit of background here and finish this sentence for me building a second brain almost didn't happen but then building a second brain almost didn't happen so many times but if I had to pick one uh I realized that I could do online courses in a very different way than they had been done up until that point and decided to take a chance on it mhm your online courses so that would be mainly these cohorts these one month transformational intensives that would teach someone how to do digital Knowledge Management and progress their projects along yes exactly okay and You' ran 19 of these over the years yep but there won't be a 20th no why is that 19 is my wife Lauren's favorite number that's one reason but also you know what happened is is we basically found other better ways of teaching it uh more efficient ways so so I wrote two books which are you know so much more accessible widely available and and affordable uh than than live online courses we have YouTube videos blog posts social media posts uh self-paced course so if people do want

###### 4

to take a course they can but we we sort of got what we were teaching in the in the second Brin cohorts and just broke it into parts and now people can kind of pick can choose the parts they want so what's the normal path for them they might find the book first now is that what you're seeing or even before then they they'll Pro probably follow us on YouTube or another social platform hear about the book bu the book and then go on to the course from there okay mhm that's really fascinating to see how things evolved so there won't be a 20th but that's okay because you have the whole ecosystem to provide and kind of meet someone with where exactly they are in their Journey exactly exactly we have we have weekly events so the other thing we have is a membership uh an annual membership that people can sign up to that has cohort likee events that same live learning experience every week throughout the whole year oh wow so that's almost like a year-long cohort you can almost think of it as nice it's really cool to see how that

###### 5

ecosystem has really just expanded to meet anyone with where they're at so let's just talk a little bit more about books because you have published two books and both of them have made waves especially building a second brain which came out about a year year and a half ago mhm so when you were writing that what books were you looking towards for inspiration I had in mind a set of books that were were non-fiction were traditionally published were in the kind of self-improvement category and I think most importantly that had really that had really been successful not just financially that's important but I looked at books that had almost like changed the culture really changed the conversation around a topic uh for example James clear's book Atomic habits obvious example David Allen's book getting things done uh cal newport's book deep work all these books were were much more than books they were almost like movements unto themselves because they I I think how they did it is they this sounds simple but is almost impossible they really captured a Zeitgeist they captured something that was already happening in the world or in the culture

###### 6

or in society and then they describe accurately provided a solution to that issue or that problem and it was a solution that many people could adopt and many people have uh I really wanted to do something like that and you know essentially change the conversation around note-taking where when people say note taking or digital notetaking they mean something different than what it meant before my book oh wow that is a really powerful framework for considering I'm in the process of of writing a book so just considering you how you approach that and how you kind of have identified those books and what their huge goals were of capturing a Zeitgeist and providing a new solution for that it's pretty fascinating um while we're still on books we know some of that influenced you while you were writing but what are some of the under the radar type of books that maybe have had an impact on you in non- obvious ways yes there's been there's definitely some books that are that are under the radar as you said um there's one called emergent strategy that is written by Adrianne Marie Brown she's a she's a

###### 7

black afrofuturist uh activist she works in activism you know trying to make a difference in social issues and this book uh who I was introduced to by my wife Lauren is is kind of at the intersection of strategy there's business strategy and things like that but also biomimicry how nature um emerges how nature finds ways of surviving reproducing thriving so those two things plus social activism somehow she intersected all those across lines across categories um which influenced me in a lot of different ways I mean one of them is is the idea that you can write a book that has no pre-existing category which in a way I think mine doesn't you know you could put it in pred activity you could put it in self-improvement but there was no personal Knowledge Management section of the bookstore there still isn't um but it kind of gave me the permission to do that that is fascinating now I have to check that one out I love the title too by the way um okay one more question or one more book related question before we really get into thiago's top 10 questions top favorite questions of

###### 8

all time um what book I guess what book do you find yourself remembering or bringing up at random times so like the one that's just kind of there and then you're in a conversation and then you just find yourself talking about it I think I'd have to say this is another very popular one but um the body keeps the score which we talked about you you I think you mentioned to me the title alone gave you like a light bulb moment it did um I read that book it was eye openening I mean that it's a it's a very extensive book it's not a short easy read he really documents so many different aspects of trauma uh I liked it in fact I didn't like it I found value in it it was kind of painful to read actually um but I found it so valuable that I summarized it on my blog and I send that link to so many different people because I think I think there's this Awakening going on in society that trauma is not this like one very specific thing you know something traumatic happened to you at one moment

###### 9

in time and you have trauma it's really kind of like a pervasive a pervasive aspect of the human condition we all have something that happened in our past or maybe something that failed to happen like we didn't get something from our parents you know um that caused our body our nervous system to be tuned or to be shaped in a certain way that no longer serves us that's my definition of trauma some way in which your body is calibrated that no longer serves you that has to be you could say heal or unlearned or just shifted uh to me is something that is is completely Universal and so I find myself not often recommending people read that book because it's like I said it's long but I'll often quote it to them or cite uh one piece of you know I'll say like oh I read some research when I say read some research I usually mean that book when it comes to trauma oh I love that and that title is is fantastic and when you brought that up that you summarized it I thought okay so I found that and I've read I

###### 10

think half I intend to read the other half just so I have a greater sense of it um that's a wonderful under the radar book yeah when it comes to books in general have you changed how you approach reading them or taking notes on them over the years or is it about the same I feel like I'm more selective at every stage I'm more selective about the content I consume in general I'm especially selective about what books I read because a book is such a massive commitment to even start reading a book it's ours right uh I'm more selective about about the books I've started as to whether I'm going to continue reading them and finish them uh I'm more selective about the notes that I that the highlights that I save during my reading I used to take far more I used to constantly be hitting the uh the 10% limit that Kindle imposes on how many highlights you can export now I never do I I take such sparse notes um so it's sort of like I mean I think that's part of discernment as you've been through the cycle of reading and

###### 11

taking notes on and taking notes on and summarizing enough books you just start to learn and and be able to predict in advance what is going to be worth the time and relatively few things are discernment that's a good word MH anything you want to say about discernment I mean it's kind of underrated right it's like you could say discernment wisdom judgment uh that's what comes with experience that's what comes with age um I'm I'm appreciating that more and more these days is that I have a life experience that is impossible to to replicate no one else has it no book contains it it's like my moat my Mo all all the knowledge is basically free and universally accessible now either through Google or chat GPT or whatever what is not universally accessible and never will be is my life experience so I guess just the value that I place on that is going up over time yeah okay couple more and then we're finally to your questions when did you actually start writing in a public way yeah it goes pretty far back the first time that I really sat down and wrote something

###### 12

significant that was not demanded of me required of me wasn't part of school was when I was 14 years old uh at that age in 1998 uh my parents moved me and my three siblings from Southern California Orange County to Brazil we went and lived there for a year because my mom is Brazilian and they said you know what we want them to have Brazilian cultural exposure and to learn the language and so we went down there and lived and Brazil is just such a magical random place the things that would happen in this small town that we lived were so unusual you know the the characters we would meet the festivals the the food the random things we would eat it was like living in a fairy tale or like a like a alternate reality I these experiences were so unusual that I had to sit down and write about them and the medium I chose was just these long emails that I would sit down at our like early compact laptop one of the earliest laptop computers in the late 90s and I would just pen these long just stories you guys won't

###### 13

believe what happened to me today I tell the whole story I still have those emails by the way oh wow I still have them and and you know they're not in any way good writing there was almost no skill on display but I think what I took away is that I can choose to write I can no one has to make me or incentivize me or give me permission I can just sit down and do writing and the the important part was the reaction that I got back you know I would write basically to our extended family and family friends and they all not all but many of them would write back you know this was so entertaining this was so great keep writing and so that encouragement was like the first little thing that gave me that idea that I could write the feedback loop the positive feedback loop early on to get those that that sense of confidence built up and that that you have permission to write too yes I love I'm going to add that to my permission list awesome yeah I have permission to write sometimes you just need a

###### 14

reminder of the simplest things seriously seriously with your writing you you have a very popular blog I'm just kind of curious is there any article even if it's not the most popular one that you're really like proud that you've written I mean my favorite blog post I ever wrote is nowhere near the most popular ones it's called the throughput of learning was kind of the deepest I ever went on on understanding a a set of ideas very very deeply and then trying to combine them which is kind of what I like to do the most is cross crossing boundaries Crossing Borders Crossing categories I just find that so rewarding uh it was basically to give you a preview applying principles of flow in manufacturing like how factories are designed to maximize the efficiency of producing products combining that with what happens in the human mind when we learn and thinking of learning as like a production pipeline of insights going from early stage to mid-stage to late stage uh yeah it's it's there you can find it on my blog but it's it's something that I I love having written that's really cool because that

###### 15

intersection throughput is actually a term for uh what that that Pro that systems way of thinking that pipeline yeah okay and you applied it to the human mind yes that's awesome okay so we're finally to the meat and potatoes the 10 questions that are your favorite for Agency for developing agency and just overall we can say maybe excellent thinking mhm at number one how is this thing that seems bad actually good in fact how is it exactly what I need at this moment yeah gosh oh my gosh each one of these questions has such a history for me um this really comes from Michael Singer and his book The untethered soul and then his other book The Surrender experiment and Michael Singer is this entrepreneur and and kind of spiritual Guru turned spiritual Guru and he he just has this way of thinking that that or this idea that life is just your teacher life is your teacher it's just constantly there waiting patiently to teach you what you need to learn not necessarily that it has a will of its own it's not it's not necessarily God you could call that God but it

###### 16

doesn't have to be God there's no theological belief necessary which I like uh it's really more like just think reality is just going to treat you the same way as everyone else will give you no special treatment but because reality just is the way it is it doesn't it doesn't modify itself for anyone you will through living rub up against the parts of reality that you don't understand that you don't accept and that you don't Embrace and you'll keep rubbing up against them you'll keep hitting that little sharp edge until you accept it and embrace it um and I've just really come to believe this that if you think of the world as your teacher reality is your teacher just ask yourself what message does it seem to be trying to get me to understand what experience keeps repeating itself uh what pattern keeps repeating itself in my experience that I could learn something from uh and often I find you know something bad is happening to me you know let's say uh I don't know I have a someone on on social media who's trolling me and they keep trolling me again and again

###### 17

and again I can get angry I can resist it I can resent them I can try to ignore them I can block them but if if it keeps happening usually I can find I can I can ask myself this question and just be like what is this repeat troll trying to teach me what what is the lesson what is the truth you know they they may be saying accusing me of things and calling me bad names that are 99% false and not not correct but most things have at least a little bit of Truth they might have only 1% of Truth and 99% false but if you can find that little one% % of truth then no experience in life is wasted no even even bad experience even negative experience is something that shouldn't have happened to you or something that you regret it's just another lesson that reality is trying to teach you that's really fascinating that's that's a really nice example too all right let's move on to the second question so how can I turn up the chaos SL entropy in the situation conversely how can I turn down the chaos entropy

###### 18

so that's interesting that you have both what's that about yeah this this is such a powerful one you know you know where this kind of came from there was an old software program I think it was um handbreak the handbreak app that some people out there used to use to um to convert their pirated torrented videos H from how could how could they how could they such terrible people uh back when you know Torrance were a thing um and and in that software there's a setting that says entropy oh there's like it's like a slider you just go oh how much entropy in this video do you want less or more and that probably has to do with like how lossy the compression is for the video or something but I almost saw it as like a Sci-Fi thing because I also read a lot of sci-fi I'm sure we'll talk about that we like imagine if you had I think when I saw that little dial I I thought what if you had like a dashboard for reality like for for your your your surroundings and you could you know turn up the like

###### 19

the speed of time okay let's make time go faster slower you could turn you know the seasons oh it's winter turn into summer you could turn up the interestingness of the conversation you're having like you could just dial in the experience you want to have and what if one of those dials was entropy you're like I'm bored just turn up the chaos just inject chaos into this environment or you're kind of overwhelmed and you turn it down lower entropy uh and that's basically what I try to do I just find that there's a spectrum between Order and Chaos um neither one is better like this to me was a big Insight we tend we tend to at least in the northern hemisphere developed countries us culture we have a bias towards order we like to control we like to have kind of order with things um but I know from my experience in Brazil where they do not have that bias in fact by default things are much more chaotic but wonderful things come out of that chaos a lot of fun you know you're in the street and suddenly someone takes out a drum

###### 20

and then a guitar and then there's a band and people are playing music and then people come out of their homes and before you know it there's like a street party that no one organized and you're just like wow this can only happen because the level OFA of chaos and entropy in this Society is higher it just is and so often when I'm in an environment you know I'll just I'll just ask like we're having a meeting with the team this is a good example and you know those meetings where where it's like everything that is being said is completely predict predictable you know what's going to be said you're going through the agenda every point you know what each you know what each person is going to say okay Bob is going to say the thing he always says Alex over here is going to say the thing she always says and you're just like I just had this thought why have an experience that is completely predictable there's no value in that and so I'm sure sometimes this is a bit you know disruptive and concerning but I'll just try to bring in

###### 21

a completely unrelated topic or say something that's a bit provocative or challenge something you know like this project that we just spent the last two weeks planning what if we just didn't do it that's an example like bringing out of left field a whole other option that people didn't even think was on the table is a way of kind of amping up the the entropy big question number three what would it look like to dial up the scope making it much better than would normally be expected how can I dial down the scope make just an MVP minimum viable product yeah I feel like I learned this uh when I started my career uh working for a consulting firm in Silicon Valley in my mid-20s uh The Lean Startup that book by Eric Reese was I mean all the rage it was totally change it was every startup in Silicon Valley was trying to be a Lean Startup which was just this idea that you should launch something an MVP a minimum viable product something basic and simple uh test it with real customers and then iterate from there to make it better which today

###### 22

soundss just like common sense like what else would you do back in the uh early 2010s that was very new right so in a way I'm getting That Lean Startup way of thinking and trying to apply it to everything else so the way I would think of this is when you're trying to finish a creative project write a book or a screenplay or launch a website or start a blog usually when people when people commit to something like that they have in mind a very fixed scope they have a a very specific set of features for example let's say you're trying to start a blog oh well it needs its own its own website right with its own URL a nice URL people can remember and it's got to have certain colors and it's got to have a name and it's got to have a banner across the top and it's got to have the categories and on and on and on there's probably dozens of things but it doesn't need all those things right it really doesn't maybe one day it could have those things but a Blog could be you know something so

###### 23

much smaller and EAS easier something that you could do in a fraction of the time um and so one thing I like to do is you know we're trying to launch something that feels big how do we another way of asking this is like how could we do that with on10th the effort or one tenth the time or on10th the cost and often once you ask those questions you realize oh there is a miniature version there's an MVP version of this that we could get out there it won't be the best thing it'll be kind of rough but even there's even value in that because when people see something rough they're more willing often to give you like good feedback than if it looks all polished that's that's really fascinating and I've seen that just kind of in the the way that you interact on Twitter so Twitter seems like it's also part of that minimal viable product testing ground where you can just throw some ideas out there yes exactly this is a great example it's it's I just have found over time that when I have an idea a little spark in my

###### 24

head if I think if if my thinking goes oh oh this is this is a really good idea this is a special idea I really need to preserve it and protect it and then I need to carefully cultivate it and develop it over a long period of time and really give it everything I have that idea is going to die and never see the light of day I just know it but I found with Twitter and social media in general to to counteract that that going down that path which is my natural default I just say oh I have an idea I think it's a good idea put it on social media immediately if it doesn't get some sort of feedback some sort of reflection back and other people also think it's good then I then it should die and I just let it go yeah that is so powerful and I noticed that same phenomenon in myself when I'm thinking I need to hold on to this idea those are the ones that then get suffocated and you allow them I see this so naturally you allow them a way to breathe yeah so

###### 25

that's really cool to see the down scoping that you might do dial down the scope of something and uh different ways to dial it up I I love that prompt question number four four when facing a problem what is Upstream of this problem that might be easier to address what is Downstream this is a um I'm starting to remember where some of these came from in almost all cases they've been borrowed from someone or some place that I heard them this is a Silicon Valley idea I don't actually know that the true origin but it's something that you'll hear Silicon Valley people say a lot is what's Upstream of that so that's just kind of a a weird way of saying what caused that but I think what it gives you is the idea that there could be many causes often when You Face a problem it's not it didn't just arise out of nowhere and it wasn't even one thing that caused it there was a whole series of events you know you have a uh you get a big unexpected tax bill this has happened to me this is a real example okay

###### 26

it's annoying it's a big bummer but you can really ask and I I remember at the time when when this happened a couple years ago uh when I had to do this all so many things happened you know I I wasn't in close communication with my tax preparation person I didn't send them before that I didn't send them all the documents early enough for them to to kind of give me a fair warning uh didn't make uh all of my estimated tax payments on time it's like you can trace it back back back back all the way to things that happened years ago like I I remember that when I was younger my it's funny my dad he would just not pay estimated taxes and just pay the penalty he was like yeah that's fine like I'd rather rather not deal with it so I'm like wow every problem I face can be traced back to a whole past series of events um and I can and it's often what this question is getting at is it's often easier to address one of those earlier earlier causes before it becomes the big issue you're facing

###### 27

yeah that makes so much uh powerful sense too to see that kind of effect because we all have these problems and then just recognizing okay what is Upstream trying to see if we can solve it there and then Downstream so now we're talking about effects and where the effects of not addressing a problem that is uh yeah yeah so that this one's less less intuitive because you think well Downstream how can what happens Downstream affect what's Upstream like the causality see would seem to go one way but it doesn't if you think about a river uh if it gets stopped up or damned it will it will pile up the the the water but also the logs and the debris all the way back up far up River um and I think that's true when it comes to information any part of my life that starts to have information overload whether it's my email inbox too many browser tabs on my browser window too many items on my to-do list too many notes in my notes app anywhere it's because it has almost always because it has nowhere to go there's no Downstream place there's

###### 28

no exit for that information and so it just piles up piles up piles up until it's totally overwhelming see that's funny because I was like how does might this be easier to address Downstream and I didn't want to ask you that because I didn't think there was an answer but then you then you answered it I'm like oh it makes sense now yeah things get log jammed and then backed up okay uh and that that that's really can be liberating because then I can look at my emails tonight and say okay this this is an issue and then I can try to apply some of that that mindset to it to um unclog that part of it maybe by looking elsewhere yeah that's great question number five how is the opposite of what I think believe also true how can I borrow elements of that opposite truth to incorporate into my own worldview yeah I feel like this is a this is an important one in this day and age of so much polarization um and I think where this comes from is growing up in so many ways with one foot in one culture

###### 29

and another foot in a different culture so there was like one foot in my the American side of my family and then the other foot in the Brazilian side but also you know my dad is Catholic my mom is Protestant um also I grew up in Orange County which is super socially conservative but my my dad is an artist and quite liberal and we had a very C mopolitan very Multicultural and diverse upbringing so I sort of had the the liberal effect too uh I was raised on the west coast but then I went to school initially on the East Coast like I I keep finding in my life you know being analytical naturally but also being really interested in creativity I always am straddling some sort of Border um and so I find if there is a contentious issue or even just a disagreement at work usually what causes conflict and disagreement is people are looking at an issue from two sides but there is actually a lot of common ground just in general as humans we actually mostly have many of the same values it's just the way that we interpret them that's

###### 30

different so I'll give you a very practical example which I encountered when I uh went to school and I studied International Affairs basically Politics on the east coast in Washington DC and started getting really familiar with all these kind of hot button social issues so this could be controversial we're going to we're going to dive in uh gun control super po like hyper polarized right personally my personal belief Thiago is that there should be a lot more gun control I think we should regulate guns but if I just hold on to that tily and say everyone who disagrees with this is wrong and bad that's just not helpful I can look at say an extreme gun libertarian who wants no regulation and I can see so much that we have in common uh they're appreciation of freedom I also appreciate Freedom their uh suspicion of the government I also am suspicious of the government their um desire to protect to protect traditional ways of life such as rural ways of life I also am interested in that so you can kind of like like find a way to find common ground and then borrow parts

###### 31

of it's really it's really strange it's like you can see them as an enemy or you can see them as a collaborator borrow parts of their worldview incorporate it into your own and then not only does own worldview gets stronger and more and more interesting but you can also relate to people that might otherwise be like on the whole other side of a debate yeah that's that is where it gets interesting that whole incorporation of opposite worldviews and how it can allow one to be more connective connected to the people around them yeah I love that one yeah number six when I find myself judging someone how is my judgment of them really a projection of parts of myself I can't love or accept how would embracing those parts give me more freedom yes um this really comes I think I first this first on on me doing Landmark Landmark is this educational company that has a series of seminars and workshops that are was one of my first introductions to like intensive personal growth like like a program designed for personal growth which I did back in San Francisco uh and I remember I

###### 32

I I had a series of realizations about this as I was doing the landmark programs then I did a tweet storm and that was my first viral so my first viral tweet it was the first thing that really took off uh and so I guess maybe that was one of the reasons it stuck with me but it's basically this idea that if anyone annoys you even just Ju Just a little bit or especially if they they really annoy you if they really trigger you you know why should why should anyone annoy you ever there's just a another person over there another organism that is just making sounds with their mouth why should that trigger Sensations and reactions in your body and in your mind and your emotions that makes no sense um I think the reason that's happening is they're reminding you of something about yourself they're reminding you of a part of yourself which is sort of being reflected back to you like a mirror because we're all mirrors for each other so when you look at that person you're really looking into a mirror seeing yourself the parts that you're noticing the annoying

###### 33

parts are the parts of yourself you don't like you don't accept you don't embrace you don't love and so you can use annoyance and an and being um and getting triggered by people as a as a teaching method you can really ask kind of going back to the first question this way that I'm being triggered or aggravated what part of myself my psyche my psychology is being pointed to as something that I could just accept about myself that's really valuable it's almost like a that you become a walking Geer counter like oh there's that's nuclear material um I need to deal with that yes in myself I like that way of putting it yes I I love um that ability that judgment that's definitely something I've noticed for myself recently that annoyance and seen that as um more of a signal uh to to reflect on yeah yeah it's um it's humbling too it's so humbling and it gives you compassion for people you know if there's uh like like I'll just give one example I used to get so annoyed by people who would get angry in public someone you know yelling because they

###### 34

got a parking ticket or having a public altercation somewhere you know I was like they they should be ashamed how dare they that is so rude so inappropriate all these lists of judgments until I eventually realized that the reason that that was getting to me is I don't allow myself to show anger or other emotions too openly which is really ultimately a restriction on myself that's a constraint that I placed on myself which gets to the end of the question which is like is like you know sometimes you see someone they annoy you you you then see the projection you're making for yourself but then you're like well so what like you you almost need a little motivation a little extra motivation to then let go of it and that motivation for me comes when I ask okay by letting go of this you know restriction of not being able to show my emotions in public how can I have more freedom and I can almost always find ways that I would have more freedom and then I'm motivated to actually do it interesting so you don't just go out of your way though to

###### 35

yell at the top of your lungs at that moment could no yeah it's funny I mean maybe one day that will be the there are probably situations where that's appropriate you know um but currently it manifest as just just a moderate more willingness Maybe 10 or 20 or 30% more you know uh openness that I have towards that yeah mhm that's great okay question number seven how can I start this with abundance also how can I start this with scarcity which that one's quite interesting for me yeah I think this has to do with um earlier we talked about how when people think of say a creative project they have a certain scope in mind like this is this is the extent or this is the set of features that it needs to have um I think kind of related to that is when we think of taking on a project or goal I think we tend to just assume a certain amount of preparation is needed right and we just that doesn't come from anywhere it's just something we make up you know if I say okay uh Nick you're going to take a

###### 36

vacation to Iceland okay immediately do you have a sense of even even vaguely the amount of effort and preparation that you will likely do for that trip I have a sense yeah like a vague sense right yeah mhm which is not Universal some other people would be like ah I'll just hop on a plane tomorrow other people will be like I need to spend a whole year researching every as aspect of Iceland's history you know so so really what that tells me is that estimation of how much effort it's going to take is internally it's it's more about our personality and our attitude towards change and uncertainty and risk rather than anything about the external World h and so what this question is getting at is so abundance I find some sometimes you want to over prepare you know you're going to go and write an article and you want to really amass like way more material than you need like 10 times as much and sometimes that's helpful because then as you're writing and you get stuck especially if you have an awesome not taking system wink wink you just pull things in real

###### 37

time you don't have to like go back to the drawing board um that one's kind of obvious but sometimes it pays to have way less preparation you know it pays to do 1110th or 100th as much whether you call it preparation or getting ready or research or whatever it is and sometimes you can you find a way to pull it off so so I don't know I just like to play with that so the one I wasn't expecting there was how can I start this with scarcity because typically we hear we you want you need to have an abundance mindset and so I was just curious to see and so you kind of see that um manifesting as when it's scarcity sometimes it's just less preparation less having to get all the ducks in a row before crossing the street yeah yeah it's similar to how if you if you take away the assumption that order in chaos is good or bad same thing with abundance and scarcity what what if abundance and scarcity are neither good nor bad neither right nor wrong neither uh you know nothing like that like moral judgments just take

###### 38

those out mhm it's it's just two ends of a spectrum and as you move the slider again back and forth new options open up new possibilities arise new ideas arise there's actually a lot of um situations you know this idea of going on an information diet that a lot of people are thinking about these days you know consuming less not just social media but less information less news even reading less books just less is an example where artificial scarcity imposing in this case information scarcity on yourself can actually uh produce better you know a less stress a better State of Mind you sleep easier yeah that's so interesting because scarcity in one domain allows for abundance potentially in another one exactly I'd love to see the scarcity abundance slider as part of your imaginary virtual dashboard I need to add that on there next to chaos entropy chaos up scarcity down what does that do we're about to find out I love it maybe that leads into question eight how would an extraterrestrial alien who knows nothing of our history or culture view this I love this one this really comes from Reading tons and

###### 39

tons and tons of sci-fi books what I would notice I read like over a hundred sci-fi books in fact the blog post that I wrote about what I learned from Reading 100 sci-fi books was my first viral piece of writing back in the day um I would notice that I I would I mean sometimes hours upon hours reading the Sci-Fi books and then I would I would step away with such a sense of perspective you know I'm reading about how they are you know doing gravity Engineering in the 27th century that's where my mind has been immersed in for the past few hours and then I step out of my room and like you know the toilet's clogged and it's like this doesn't matter this is this is inconsequential like on the scale of which I'm aware of and which I care about this this is a this is less than a blip so kind of gives me gives me that sense of perspective and I would often notice that I could sort of see things through the eyes of aliens so many sci-fi stories are about aliens and humans meeting and often you kind

###### 40

of are on the side of the aliens you're like gosh these humans they they stink you know the aliens are like often more not just more technologically advanced but more fair more ethical they're more they treat they treat their their people better and so I would start to view a lot of life situations as if I was an alien and I had enough sort of exposure to alien thinking in the form of Science Fiction to do that uh and so I always imagine I imagine an alien ship just in orbit far above the Earth and they're just observing they're like anthropologists they might be like picking up our radio signals maybe connecting to to the internet and seeing some things but just passively observing imagine if you were to talk to this alien and you were to tell them your problem they would they would be so far removed from all from everything the only thing that you would have in common if you think about it is like the laws of physics that they would understand if you if you you know complain if if you or just said something related to the loss

###### 41

of phys physics they would be like okay that makes sense um information science that you would have in common they would probably which is based in math like you would share math right and not much else maybe maybe biological evolution maybe like natural selection they had a version of that back home but besid besides those things nothing with history culture music art uh human psychology relationship social psychology none of that would have any relevance to them and so I always imagine what they would say which I I think that what that that does is it removes the what the culture says is inherently right wrong good and bad which is so deeply entrenched in how we view the world it's really hard to remove that kind of moralistic lens but once you do things just you can just see them with more perspective see that's it you you say surprisingly profound things very often and now I know why why because of this question because you're putting on that lens of thinking like if I was an extraterrestrial alien what would what would they think of this yes like that's oh my gosh it's such

###### 42

a powerful one it can help in any situation anything uh I should probably think of an example but like like I'll just make up an example this one's not real you know I imagine like you know someone getting in their little space shuttle going up to you know to the aliens and and getting some coaching from the aliens and imagine like one of the most dramatic human situations my spouse cheated on me what do I do it's devastating the worst thing you can imagine the alien would be like oh okay um well first of all uh your species which is really just one of million ions so you don't you don't you're not like that important but your species in particular you know has evolved sexual reproduction which is just one way of reproducing you could you could probably figure out and engineer others but if you want to stick with that uh within that you've invented this concept of um of you know monogamy which I have to tell you is very weird like and you could just imagine that that conversation continuing they're basically getting the whole there's a whole multiple layers of

###### 43

assumptions underlying the simple statement that being cheated on is bad there's like a there's like a hundred assumptions underneath that and an alien would just eliminate discard or de really deconstruct most of those assumptions and by the time they're done you'd probably I mean you would just I don't know if you would not care that you were cheated on but You' be in a very different state of mind yeah and I find you can do some of that deconstruction yourself on yourself that is such a fantastic mental model that I'm going to stick in like the toolbox like a thought experiment that you can just pull back pull out whenever you need it yes I love it yes question number nine what is the feeling I'm avoiding feeling right now how can I feel it yeah gosh this comes from um the work I've done the personal work I've done on what I would call either emotional intelligence or emotional fluidity I think for most of my life growing up until just pretty recently few years ago uh I was so left-brained so biased toward the analytical The Logical the rational there really was a

###### 44

time that I thought I could solve all of life's problems if I am just totally rational do not let any emotion or bias or subjectivity into it and needless to say that is absolutely not true um and so I started doing things it started really with meditation just simple you know um silent meditation some of Lamark which I mentioned uh psychedelics uh working with different teachers and coaches such as Joe Hudson who you now know uh and what I've discovered one of the many things I've discovered is that often when the mind gets busy like it starts getting really frantic and Manic and and worrying about things and getting anxious and trying to come up with answers it's really because there's an emotion in the body that's blocked the emotion wants to move it wants to be processed but if you stop it so let's say let's say there is um one emotion that I that I know I have trouble feeling is helplessness the feeling of being helpless of being powerless I hate that feeling probably some other people do too right but if that feeling arises and I'm starting to feel helpless if

###### 45

I block it and I I do have that choice in fact there's some research that there's an actual constriction in the body you know like like to hold that that feeling down any feeling down you there's actually a muscle somewhere in your body your chest your shoulders your back your legs that has to tense and that's where emotional repression can lead to physical symptoms MH but if I hold it some very undesirable things are going to start happening my mind is going to start getting busy anxiety is going to go up might lose sleep I'm not going to be as present I'm going to Crave uh distraction I'm going to Crave stimulation like and sometimes I just ask myself okay I don't really want to feel this feeling I really don't want to go down that path of all those side effects so what I've discovered and this is so amazing is you can just sit and just decide to feel it just set aside 15 minutes it's that easy sometimes it's that easy sometimes I need help play some music do some journaling take a walk talk to people sometimes you have to take

###### 46

certain actions to kind of provoke it and get it to the surface but sometimes I really can just be like helplessness just like keep saying the word and then it it's unpleasant it's like a it's like a it's like almost like acid reflux this feeling fills your body and it's just like H but then within just minutes it passes and then you're done with it and then you can kind of move on and I find that that what I I just described is so uh accessible and efficient rather than spending a week trying to process it through other means that I just try to do it whenever I can you know that that is so effective because I think with the first part of this question what is the feeling I'm avoiding feeling right now I think I was able to kind of do part of that and I could realize that if I grabbed my phone it was likely to distract from whatever I'm feeling and uh but I only got that far really I think it's that second part how can I feel it that I think really packs the punch of where

###### 47

the you could call it healing whatever the moment needs though to get through that feeling so it doesn't manifest itself in strange ways um the body is kind of like whack-a-mole where you you you suppress all the moles but then when they do come up they're all like you know they're they're all messed up and um so I really love the the two-parter there because the how can I feel it and with those suggestions you provided very uh practical and empowering thank you question 10 last of thiago's 10 favorite questions what is the bottleneck in the current system how can I relieve it such that the whole system changes this comes from the theory of constraints which is a entire discipline um that emerged from a book published in I think the 70s or 60s called the goal by an Israeli physicist named Ellie G pretty in fact it's obscure but also it's like one of the bestselling non-fiction books of all time and this this book I I have an 11p part series on my blog which is really just still an introduction um that you can check out if if the viewers are

###### 48

interested in learning more but I would boil it down by saying that you can think of almost anything as a system this room is a system your body is a system the camera that we're using to film this as a system and when you think of a system uh there's always a bottle NE there's always one place that is most restricted most constrained most limited and one of the greatest insights from the theory of constraints is that any system only has one bottleneck it has one strictest smallest bottleneck there might be many limitations but there's one that is the most limited and he has this phrase only Improvement at the bottleneck makes a difference often when we're trying to improve something there's we want improve everything except the core problem the core problem is the core problem because it's threatening or it's complicated or it's ambiguous and so we'll polish everything else but the main thing and what I just love about the theory of constraints is it just constantly has you ask this question which is you know let's just take an example um I don't know as a company we're trying to make

###### 49

more money it's a common goal right somewhere in the company there is one constraint that is the most limiting or holding us back the most more than anything else that doesn't mean there's not many things that need Improvement there's practically infinite but there's one that is like the bottleneck and this question has you constantly ask what truly is the bottleneck and then you think you have it and you try to improve that bottleneck if the whole system doesn't improve then that wasn't it Improvement at the bottleneck you know it's the bottleneck cuz it improves the whole system so if I think the bottleneck to us growing as a business is more email subscribers that's the bottleneck and we spend a month or two FOC totally focused on that doing everything we can to increase email subscribers if revenue or profit or whatever we're measuring did not go up that was not the bottleneck as good as it feels to have improved that that that really makes this come alive I didn't know how fixing a bottleneck in the system could make the whole system change the way you described it it makes sense and it's

###### 50

a great it's a great Belle weather to say did I did that change yes affect the system or not yes that's wonderful yeah that's great so those are your 10 favorite questions for agency and let's just say excellent thinking yeah anytime I'm stuck or I just feel bogged down in anything whether it's a spe specific project or just in life you know stuckness that's a madeup human concept no animal ever feels like in a creative funk you know that's that's an invention of our minds and so and so Freedom must come from the mind the constraints that I'm facing the roadblocks I'm facing even if it seems like it's something in the external world I I have to believe it's actually something in my mind and asking these questions is a way of just playing with my mind is really what it is it's like getting my mindset and and the set of beliefs that I'm currently holding and just mixing them up turning them upside down turning them in a circle adding things removing things to see if that helps and it almost always does I have one rapid fire question in an alternate

reality where Evernote disappeared tomorrow where would you go I mean I'd have to say after the video that we uh that we just recorded earlier this morning which you should definitely check out on my channel uh obsidian is kind of the clear Contender like the clear upand cominging um strongest Contender Contender for second brain apps okay well you heard it here first everyone um with that in mind we covered a lot of questions and as we wrap up with your 10 favorite questions what do you think a good one to leave everyone who's listening with I think it's whichever one of the 10 that we talked about that resonated with you which one kind of broke your brain a little bit which one was the furthest out of left field from how you normally think is a great place to start okay so keep that in mind Trust your intuition and just to wrap up this is Thiago Forte you can find him on Twitter at for labs and on YouTube under Thiago Forte his first bestseller building a second brain and his latest the pair method can be found on Amazon and wherever books
