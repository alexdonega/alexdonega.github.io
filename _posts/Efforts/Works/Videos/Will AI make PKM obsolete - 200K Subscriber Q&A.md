###### 1

hello everyone welcome back to the channel if you're new here this is linking your thinking I'm Nick Milo and we talk about the how and why of notes thinking better and really making the most of our mind today's video is a special thank you Q&A to celebrate us reaching over 200,000 subscribers here on YouTube we have your questions from the YouTube Community post and to help you save time we have timestamps in the description below let's get into it round one question one what's my favorite ice cream flavor it has to be cookies and cream but I'm curious what's your favorite are you affiliated with obsidian no they haven't paid me anything and I pay for their services just like anyone else I do my best to popularize ways of better thinking my tool of choice just so happens to be obsidian because of the million reasons I've talked about everywhere else I'd like to think that it's a mutual admiration between both of us but at the very least I admire that whole team a lot here's a deep question from Karen Nick I'd love to know the similarities and any big differences between

###### 2

child Nick under age 12 and adult Nick with examples please thanks for that question Karen so child Nick had a temper on him he chased his older brother head first into the fireplace twice leaving two scars on his forehead he was physically very active he had so many bruises from plane outside that on a doctor's visit the doctor actually pulled my mom aside to ask if my dad was the cause of them young Nick child Nick was very curious he asked his great uncle how the buttons on his sweater vest could possibly hold that big belly within that one didn't go over too well adult Nick doesn't have that same temper I think I learned to channel it into two things uh passive aggressiveness and work I'm getting much better with the former because I'm a little bit more able and capable to express my thoughts and emotions and that has just grown over time I still love physicality though so that's the same as child Nick and I just never feel like adult Nick is getting enough movement but I am getting more and finding ways to get more and more including dancing and

###### 3

last I am just as curious if not more so now so I love that question thank you Karen and here's a question for you have you watched more than three of my videos have they been worth your time if so please consider subscribing below it's the only way more people can find my channel in the YouTube algorithm and in return I'll do my best to keep delivering my best for you the next question comes from Sabine your light Community is exceptional how did you come up with your style of hosting and managing it well for starters it definitely wasn't planned it's truly a result of the people the people who have had the largest impact on the community for the longest amount of time are Dan lardy and Katon sreel there are about 20 others who without the community wouldn't be what it is so I'm sorry I can't say everyone's name right now but that's really been the core that's allowed this Community to become what it is now I think platforms are far less important we started on discourse which was not even made for Community but we worked really hard to make

###### 4

it probably the most unique discourse experience possible then we added Discord briefly before we dropped it and that was just because it kind of split the community in half so that caused more confusion than anything and now this last year we moved to Circle and I think we'll stay there for the foreseeable future but at the end of the day I really think the community has to do with two really important thing Vibes and truly caring now if we project the right Vibes coming from me coming from Dan Keaton anyone else with the team and if we truly care then that's what's going to make all the difference thanks for that question okay we are on to round two you ready for this okay round two first question comes from Eric how good of a college football player were you well I wasn't good enough to attempt to play division one college football I played in a division called naaia and honestly I don't know what that stands for no one at that level was on a full ride scholarship I can tell you that so you were truly a student athlete and not an

###### 5

athlete who happens to also take classes um that said in my four years we won three national championships and I was an All-American cornerback and punt returner but my proudest achievement was being voted by my teammates as team captain my senior year okay here's the next question once you realize that an stands for map of content once you realize that you need to split that big map into maybe submaps do you recommend keeping the link in all the the notes below to the first parent Moc or do you add links now to these sub smaller moc's to related notes I hope I got that question right from you Brett I think you're asking about which of these Maps should you link all these individual notes to as the Uplink so essentially you have two choices one of the new submaps or the this parent map that you started with the correct answer is one of them both of them or none of them all are fine now if you're curious what I would do I would link to one and I would make sure that's the most relevant one so what is the most relevant

###### 6

one for you you'll have to decide that on your own but I hope that gives you some guidance thanks for the question so if all this talk about Maps is making you want to learn how to link notes better then grab my free email course the ultimate primer to linking your thinking and that link is in the description below next question I subscribed because I was dealing with too many outside influences without enough reflection what resources do you have Nick that you use to spark your ideas how do you find so many interesting ideas to think about and that comes from Chase I have strong opinions here because too many people are caught in the wrong streams the wrong algorithms what are those to me the wrong algorithms to me are hustle culture toxic productivity and definitely hyperpolarized politics what do all of these have in common they don't compel imagination they don't inspire a and wonder and they just aren't fun I don't use resources to spark my ideas I consume things that spark my curiosity and then the ideas they take care of themselves but to answer your question practically sci-fi and classic

###### 7

literature both enrich my mind to levels that only these really rich one-on-one conversations can match Don kyote for example this is about a silly man who thinks he's a knight that taught me more than 10 self-help books could and not only that but it it doesn't hurt that reading sci-fi and literature and fiction overall it just makes you generally way more interesting to be around additionally quality movies I get a lot of great ideas or concepts from quality movies and even a few TV series because of the time investment though not too many so I kind of make sure that it's going to be worth my time before I really syn my teeth into it next question hi Nick what an opportunity in spite of the course I'm still struggling with overwhelm when I turn to my PKM to build something could you share some workflows and settings that help you get started in the right direction thanks for that question Matt so without knowing any specifics I can only share what I would do I would create a new note and start throwing all my ideas and all my links to existing notes into

###### 8

it basically create a new note and do a brain dump then organize that brain dump you you know organize that stuff a bit move it around then here's the key start writing or building you know whatever it is that you're working on so you enter in one of the unique individual notes and you start writing or building in there until you get stuck then go back to the big map note and either reorganize a bit or just immediately find another idea or note that you can hop into and this tacking back and forth is really how it works so just depending where you're at try to create a new note dump everything in there kind of cluster up that information but then start immediately writing or building or whatever it is that thing that you're working on is when you get stuck you go back to the map then you go back into a new place start writing building you get stuck there you go back to the map and then we're just doing this micro to macro macro to micro that's all we're doing and if we do that hopefully that can move you

###### 9

long that Arc framework we talk about add relate communicate that should get you all the way through relate into communicating where you can package whatever it is you're building or you can share whatever it is that you're writing thanks for that question Matt because you're not alone but what I know by now is that you've built up all the tacit knowledge that comes with note apps you know how to link you know how to do all these things so from my perspective you are so close and I really hope that tacking back and forth create a map put everything in there and then start writing or building maybe that can get you through the Finish Line fingers crossed all right round three what are your fave YouTube channels and movies also what is the most valuable thing for you I'm going to skip the valuable thing question I will answer about my favorites my favorite movies uh and I've given a lot of thought about this this list has been ongoing for as long as I can remember but number one right now is Lord of the Rings Fellowship of the Ring number two is

###### 10

Rocky tied two three and four I think are all tied Rocky Groundhog Day and The Matrix so that's my top four my favorite YouTube channels H well I don't want to necessarily do my favorite so I'm going to do my Hidden Gem YouTube channels the ones that you may not have heard of so let me do four Hidden Gem YouTube channels the first is Michael Sue gry that's for philosophy he has amazing pieces he used to teach at one of the IV leagues and now in his older age he just sits in front of the camera and talks about n shoing Hower and even Don kyote what Michael sugra had to add he added so much context and flavor to Don kyote which took me like two and a half years to read and to hear how sugra put that in context to where the author grew up that the author only had one arm that worked all these things would just blew my mind and made so much more sense to the story that I had just consumed so I love him number two not in any particular order is man carrying things and

###### 11

that's just for the absurdity number three is Quinn's ideas so Quinn talks about sci-fi books at length and I just love his Vibe and the information that he provides it's not just a recap of what the book is but he has his own flavor and ideas added to his videos really amazing stuff and he's got over 20 videos just on the three body problem which is just the latest and greatest Sci-Fi series and uh it's coming to Netflix soon that one's really interesting and it's great to to hear his ideas after going through it myself and number four on the list is pitch meeting and that's a hilarious take on movies and it's just great

###### 12

to again see what somebody else's thoughts are on the movies that I have seen for the most part unless it's a movie I know for sure that I won't want to see and then it's just kind of cool to understand really fast his his take on it now I have another question for you though which of my answers are actually sparking with you could you let me know in the comments below it would mean a lot now next question I love the concept of efforts over projects and I've walked through your idea verse course but I'm curious how do you handle individual tasks that come from the effort project task that's from Matthew so 99% of tasks I don't handle an obsidian you can I've seen people do it they tend to be fairly Advanced users so you might ask what do I do then well when I'm at the computer I'll use drafts which is a Mac iOS app and Mac app so I'll use drafts to quickly capture something and maybe it's not really a task but I might just be kind of typing words and things I want to remember but not

###### 13

necessarily add to obsidian and then the other one is things which is another great app um what I've noticed is I love the idea verse my pcam system is largely largely about ideas but if I can draw a distinction then I like to go analog and you can see here I have a little notebook and I can just keep some things here some different notes um this is on the idea verse Pro some little things consider the meetings template you know things like that so this is just a way to kind of sketch that out I found that back and forth pretty helpful next question I'll just slightly rephrase what would you do if you knew you could not fail and what would you do even if you knew you would fail I love this couplet of questions Ali abdal mentioned this in my recent interview with him and that second part what would you do even if you knew you would fail that definitely made this Splash in my mind I was like whoa and I think Alli said that he would be a magician because even if he failed on stage the act

###### 14

of getting ready you know performing different tricks learning different skills putting on a show would still be worth it so if I had to answer that question even if I failed I would be a college football coach even if we had a losing record as a team I would still have helped raise quality men and that means a lot to me next question do you have a system for task management if so what is it what software do you use and is it integrated with your idea verse I kind of addressed this a little bit earlier but I digitally capture with drafts or things and it's very Loosely I I don't follow any strict systems what I'm finding is that analog is working quite well for me so I'll tell you two things that I'm doing so this is um called a gbon techno planner and it is an analog planner I just started using it but actually really really love it because it is all for me I I have zero ideas in here but there are a few tasks that I can just simply put right here and I can just kind of

###### 15

plan my day and I love my pilot g2s however I've started to switch my pens from Pilot g2s to a single pen that has four colors and it's a friction pen and I I didn't think this was for me but now I can erase things so if I can see like today uh in this evening I'm going to work on the newsletter but if that changes I can actually erase the pen and it's pretty it's like heat sensitive ink so I actually found this really helpful that doesn't mean that I don't use a digital calendar because I totally do but this just kind of keeps me on point throughout the day and that's how I've been using this so I love this jibon techno planner um I'm not you know not sponsored or anything it's just really cool and then when it comes to just tasks and little things then I use this one which is called a hobonichi techco and I think I said techno earlier but I meant to say techco I don't know what that means it probably means planner in uh Japanese but uh this one's really great for those little

###### 16

thoughts again I got a few others here I can share you know consider meetings template scope out videos can I crack the outputs template you know clean up the prominent people so this is all idea verse Pro stuff that you can see that I'm working on next page consider the idea template how our Concepts going to be handled so it's kind of a way for me to just even if it's not a clear task like go pick up milk it is asking me to do something or it's prompting me to think about something and I love the analog to digital split there so if it's kind of planning or task based analog is is not bad but again I'm not dogmatic about much the only thing that I'm probably a little um dogmatic about is the value of being able to digitally link and revise and edit your ideas because you just can't do that on on analog paper to the speed or Effectiveness that you can do in digital notes in a single word digital notes are shapable whereas notes Here idea notes here they're not shapable and when we're creating this Rich evolving

###### 17

idea verse we need that shap ability so even though I ended talking about ideas I hope you can see how I'm kind of doing what people call task management I don't even those words don't even come up though so I'm just kind of trying to plan and you know keep I guess the the executive functioning analog and then when it comes to that kind of that creative aspect the connective aspect really where I'm creating value that's happening in obsidian and it's happening in my idea verse that was a big question hope you enjoyed okay let's keep going all right this is round four you ready for this next question I want to know how you use obsidian for nonot taking related content such as how you did your Fitness Boxing business or how you produce those two indie films and how you manage the film industry at large I'm kind of paraphrasing but these are all longer stories so I'm only going to answer one part of this and that's going to be in the very next question okay next question has your experiences working in the world of TV influenced your pcam idea verse

###### 18

style and methods and if so how yeah absolutely I think in three ways I think they're about three ways the first is how I built this web of connections between people in the industry to rapidly learn about the industry and navigate it effectively I would look at this person that I was in direct contact with and I would see who they worked with on past previous shows what Studios were involved what networks who they knew and I made this complex web of understanding that allowed me to be so much more intelligent in the conversations I was having I was no longer um oh what's it called a fly on the wall I was no longer a fly on the wall because I was one of them I I could speak the language and when I did interject an idea it was well received because I knew the context around it I knew what they might be thinking already or who they worked with or what shows they already had experience with so I could speak their language and obsidian wasn't around so I had to do all that in a very simple plain text program

###### 19

called the archive and that wasn't even a true link it just kind of searched for whatever you put in Brackets and that worked well enough though so that's number one number two was the amount of notes I took no one lectures at a podium in the industry but I took a lot of notes because I observed and I found things interesting I was trying to understand the shape and terrain of the industry and that really paid off as I was just mentioning and the third was how I took these notes when I zeroed in on an expert I had access to I would observe I would observe some more and then I would ask them

###### 20

a wellth thought out question they'd appreciate somebody cared so much about their work to ask them that question so they'd answer thoughtfully as well so I'd listen and you know whatever that conversation wherever it led afterwards I would rush back to my work desk and I would type out what they said but I naturally did two things that made all the difference one I added my own takeaways and comments to what they said and two I related it to something else in my notes if I didn't do those two things then I'm just a note taker doesn't matter but because I added my commentary and I related it to something else it empowered me to rise up in the industry and be valued and be sought out for future shows so in this editing example after talking with an expert in a field I might link it to editing tips and tricks or I might just link it up to the main editing map that I had next question what is the best obsidian feature which you cannot live without and the second part of this and what is the worst obsidian feature that that's

###### 21

causing you the most friction and this comes from Michael so the thing that I can't live without is linking a new note to an existing map so basically just linking it's linking a note to another note but this note happens to kind of capture a lot of different notes and we call that a map or a map of content and why that's so important is because it creates cohesion in my mind I've taken the new and I've related it to the known and this strengthens both my understanding and my ability to recall it in the future I love it now the thing that I don't love right now is changing all the inline metadata that I have to the newer obsidian properties form of metadata that just there's no easy way to do that and it's a lot of manual work I'm taking it bit by bit but I kind of have to do a lot in advance because of the product that we have IDE verse Pro and also because of obsidian flight school so that's a lot of metadata manipulation a lot of janitorial work that I'm doing right now I wish there

###### 22

was a faster way and I have to say already properties has evolved a lot where it is a lot faster but you know there's still things that get in the way okay next question are you single h no no I'm not I'm happily in a relationship this next question is a little long I'm a professional screenwriter and producer and I used your lyt light format to Simply put all my ideas in place to find the cross connection across genres and styles do you have any specific advice for creatives on how to use light better or with your work on better call all and everything you know now how would you use obsidian on the next series you work on and here's another one would you be open to doing some sort of paid thing where you help creatives by- weekly so let me try to answer all those real fast the first thing is advice I'll call it guidance if you are writing creatively in a note app where you can make links do it this way write write until you get stuck then organize until you get stuck then write some more until you

###### 23

get stuck so what you're doing is you're zooming in and out from notes for writing and notes for mapping your ideas and so this is going from the micro to the macro and it's really easy this way you just you are working you're making progress oh I got stuck what do I do now go back to the map now you can kind of see the big picture again and decide where you want to go to next and then maybe you go off in this direction you start writing or building here and then you get stuck you go back to the map and this back and forth means that you can more often stay in flow and when you do you simply have more fun and you get more quality work done for the next part of your question better call all my role was as an assistant editor which is a very specific non-writing role so I didn't have much use for obsidian for any sort of writing purpose now for future shows say like a Carl Sagen likee series what I would do is create a zoomed out mapping note a map of content

###### 24

and then I'd create all sorts of notes within it and around it I'd link to it or I'd just write within it it doesn't really matter but I'd have a running list of episode ideas and season arcs along with a running list of unsorted ideas and links that I would just want to keep handy because they're somehow related even if I don't know exactly how maybe I already have a note like this now finally how can creatives get this sort of Hands-On writing environment it's very simple um you you take the linking your thinking Workshop or I teach a class at UCLA called supercharge your writing efforts and we cover this stuff a lot so the last course was remote I think the next one however will be on campus in Los Angeles so that one I wanted to make sure the first one is remote the next one though will be on campus so I hope that answers your question and we're about to go into the next round oh hi there you caught me reading we're on to round five of questions hope you're enjoying this so far so what are the spiritualities

###### 25

and philosophies that inspired you most in your life that came from the troll power okay my spiritual and philosophical development probably began in Earnest when I was 19 now for the first time in my very cozy Mountain West United States upbringing I felt like an outsider it was at a Mass for an organized religion I tried hard to fit in those years this was these were my college Years but the in institution only allows those who convert to to be part of the In Crowd and that hypocrisy between the institution and the message it left this indelible Mark within me so that didn't really feel good so after those College Years there was a mixture

###### 26

of I would say the da ching and Benjamin Franklin's virtues and all these sort of inputs that led me down u a truer path for myself and yeah after listening to hours of Alan Watts on audio that also helped a lot that you know stoicism virtues all these things to kind of create a different sort of world viiew that makes a lot more sense to me so it's definitely infused with the Eastern it's definitely infused with the Western especially that kind of stoic tradition but I don't lean too heavily into that um and then just kind of you know finding my own way but I'm very much on the journey I'm very much traveling and enjoying that process as I go along do you think that pcam tools like obsidian will last a long time or will the AI Revolution transform fast our way of PKM and tools well PKM tools will always be around whether it's cave paintings or links in a tool like obsidian the AI Revolution won't lessen the need for us to understand ourselves AI will become incorporated into our systems but the AI will only be as good as the

###### 27

information it has to go off of so actually the the best way to prepare your PKM for AI is by writing as much as you possibly can as personally as you can but I have to give a huge warning here I will be waiting for a private local only form of AI because I I don't want my thoughts um processed in the cloud or anything like that so keep that in mind AI when it does come I prefer that is looking at my pcam system only if I can control that it's localized and private now that said the AI Revolution will distract potentially new people who would benefit from a pcam system because they won't even have time or think about that they need to discover a note-based application they won't be thinking I need to find this thing and oh obsidian's cool they'll be too busy on Netflix and TV and other forms of entertainment that already exist those people will not be able to find these note apps so in that sense AI is just another form of a dist exaction that will take people away from discovering that a PKM system is

###### 28

kind of what they need so they can calm their thoughts that they can gain Clarity that they can make sense of the world around them so in a nutshell PKM is safe from AI PKM will benefit from AI it will lose potential users however to AI via distraction but that's happening anyways with with sporting events with Netflix TV radio before that all of their forms and the people who will most benefit from AI are people who have PKM systems that have their most personalized writing within it because then we'll be able to ask and query the AI for specific information and it should be able to pull up results in ways that we can hardly even fathom right now the next question is how did you take notes as a showrunner okay just to be clear I was never a showrunner nor was I even in the vicinity of becoming one I mean at first I got people coffee so you know there's that then I scheduled actors so they could record their lines of dialogue and then then scheduled directors and you know got showrunners meals and that sort of thing then I managed

###### 29

visual effects and edits eventually I got into the editor's guild and then I started editing so that's my path and it's far different than anything to do with the writing side of the entertainment industry and especially getting to the top of a show and being that showrunner I like this question I'd love to know more background about you like family and growing up your career is Broad from Fitness to entrepreneurship to movie and now YouTube I'm intrigued how that all came about well thanks for that question I'll share a little bit I grew up in Montana every year for the 4th of July Independence Day in the states 50 plus family members and friends we would meet outside but Montana in the mountains where our extended family has 160 acres of land along the Continental Divide so we're in the Rocky Mountains here there's no electricity and as kids we got to play in the rocks and in the trees and get lost up there in in story and Adventure then as teenagers we had to help cut down trees for firewood for the big barbecue that we do we had to put up tarps

###### 30

for shade when the sun came out or hey it even hails in the mountains in the summer and we had to do about a million other things that grandma would order you to do if you dared step foot in the old ranch house before dinner was ready so that Slice of Life in nature around family working together pretty harmoniously it will always have this part of my soul it imbued me with this Foundation that feels as deep as the mountains are tall I've lived in New York City I now live in Los Angeles and while sure they they have changed me a bit because environments change all of us my core feels unwavering so that's a huge part of who I am now combine that with a self-propelled work ethic and I think you can kind of see what my life has been you can kind of get it my work ethic most clearly started the summer between 7th and 8th grade every weekday morning that summer I would wake up at 6:00 a.m. and I would run 1 and 1 half miles to the high school to lift weights in the basement dank musty

###### 31

weight room with these kids who are way older and way stronger than I was and I observed the seniors who cared more about sitting on the bench taking up space reading the newspaper than they were about doing the next set of squats even then that really disgusted me I'm still when I think about those those those guys I'm like oh you wasted your talent you wasted so much and for what the wait room was a holy place for me those next five years I went from barely being able to squat 95 PBS as a seventh grader going into 8th grade to squatting 450 lbs in competition as a 17-year-old senior in high school and what

###### 32

better example of a growth mindset than seeing it for yourself seeing that if you put in the work that you can improve at something and then that has just followed me anywhere it's like oh almost anything is is possible if you put in the work now I I won't be able to play in the NBA but you know within reason if you put in the work these things are possible and that's I think what work ethic has really instilled this growth mindset within me and then I have to at least mention the word curi osity and if you combine these three things you get to see what my life has really been about Roots drive and curiosity so those three things are always mixing together in interesting combinations and I think you can then start to kind of see oh that makes sense now hopefully that helps you kind of understand like where I am now and and how I got there thank you for that question and I hope you don't mind U me sharing a few personal stories we'll get into the bonus round next okay we are almost there this is the

###### 33

bonus round this is the final round so here we go what are your top five Inspirations for your work I love this question I knew a couple of them but you really had to make me think so in the order that I experiened them the book man search for meaning this is a book that um don't tell on me but I actually kept this we had to read it in high school English class don't tell Miss Beric that uh I kept the book and you know you can see it's marked here uh number three I kept it I still have it and uh because it made such a huge impact on me so this was number number one uh number two was the camaraderie spirit and effort that I experienced playing High School football and college football that is still the the some of the most wonderful times is that camaraderie that spirit and that effort uh number three the work of Mii Chicken miay in his book flow and all the work around flow and flow Theory flow just the idea of optimal experience um balancing Challenge and skill it is probably the number

###### 34

number one framework that I most often return to that most often flavors my thinking uh number four is Carl San I had an airplane flight I'm in my mid to late 20s and I didn't even know Carl Sean but I had a flight in the morning it was cancelled so I went back and I had an entire day to just sit around to wait for the next flight and I didn't feel like doing anything so I opened up Netflix and for some reason at that time Carl Sean Cosmos spoke to me and I was like okay let's start and over the course of that next day I made it through the series and my mind was blown it has made such an impact on me number four is Carl Sagen and that impact really is that I saw within him the thing that I would like to do for others Inspire awe and wonder and that leads me to number five the book The Little Prince that has so much awe and wonder and Whimsy and and kid-like energy curiosity really and uh and that was something that I think I was around 30 when

###### 35

I finally encountered The Little Prince so those I would say are five major Inspirations in my life next question hi I'm new to the idea verse and to the concepts that it encapsulates I was wondering about the fact that efforts in the idea verse do not have deadlines so how do you manage an effort for example related to the creation of a YouTube video how will you be able to respect a publication schedule this is a great question so I would say try adding a deadline property in the output that you are working on and see if it works for you because it might I've done it at different times what I usually find is I do better without one but everyone is different I understand that so that's why I say hey make it a tiny test it's very easy to add um a property field you can call it deadline you could call it doe publish date premier date whatever you want to put there and you can see how that works and there are ways to manage it next question do you plan to introduce new translation Technologies in your videos and

###### 36

courses there are many people who understand or translate subtitles but we are not good in English to participate in your courses thanks for that Jose that is a what I would call a simmering effort we know we want to provide translations we don't know how we are going to achieve that the solution has to be fast cheap automated and easy to implement I'm not sure where the technology is I think it's a lot closer than it used to be but it's definitely something that we would like to do and the final question oh wow okay so here it is as you allowed me to ask anything then I want to know how much money do you make on YouTube not as much as you think all I can say I won't give the exact number but all I can say is that YouTube accounted for I'm looking at this year YouTube accounted for just over 1% of what linking you're thinking as a company made so I mean YouTube has a huge impact it gets a lot of people aware of what we're up to but as far as what the revenue is from you

###### 37

YouTube 1% so the other 99% come from the light Workshop that we run obsidian flight school and a lot of it will also come from IDE verse Pro as that launches okay well we did it now I just have to know which of my answers actually sparked with you could you let me know in the comments below I've been recording for an hour and I'd really love to know what sparked with you so thank you if you can do that and if you're looking for targeted answers related to obsidian you'll definitely want to check check out my Q&A almost completely dedicated to it just click here and past Nick we'll see you there and until next time stay connected
