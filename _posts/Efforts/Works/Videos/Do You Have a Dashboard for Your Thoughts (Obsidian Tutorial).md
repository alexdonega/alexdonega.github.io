in the digital age there are only a few ways to make relationships between ideas forever we've only had folders to lump a bunch of different files kind of close to each other and that worked in the last lesson we introduced Ace and we covered how you can customize the ace folder framework but if the last lesson was about Ace for folders this lesson is about Ace for links linking your thinking by linking your notes is the funnest and fastest way to learn and remember as well as to develop ideas and create inspired work this is why it's so compelling of an idea to unify how we think with folders which we've had for ages with how we think with links which is actually how our brain naturally works anyways and this is the promise of Ace and again a stands for Atlas calendar efforts it gives us a reliable and unified system for orienting the Mind want to see how you can use Ace in your home note well let's go and welcome to the home note of the ideaverse what you'll notice here is that we have Atlas calendar and efforts which of course

###### 2

matches Atlas calendar and efforts folders over here and links are going to be over here so let's see how we do if we just get rid of folders so we can actually have more fun make more connections be able to work faster and more creatively over here with links and to start we're going to eventually twirl down Atlas but first what is home it is your launch pad and home base that's here that's home and it can Orient your mind in moments that's the power now first when we want to orient our mind around knowledge where do we usually go that's right we're going to go to the atlas so let's twirl it down now and whoa this is cool so this is some 1970s art this is not mid-journey this these are the artists who beat AI by over 50 years we're about to jump into a really cool framework called The Arc framework and then we're going to check out the library people and sources Maps some of this other stuff you'll just have to check out on your own now before I click on ADD I want to show you something not

###### 3

included in the idea verse for obsidian and that is something that we cover in the big Workshop that we do that is the arc framework this is a framework that can Empower you to reclaim the core of your creative process and master the flow of your ideas across time and space that seems like a mouthful think of it this way the arc framework gives energy to your ideas if you want to learn more about how to masterfully work with ideas to learn faster remember more and make it meaningful inspired work check out the workshop Link in the description below over a thousand students from over 66 countries from companies like apple and Nike have enrolled and experienced life-changing breakthroughs in their personal and professional lives okay I just want to show you a couple diagrams because then it will make sense when we go into the basic version that I have provided you in the ideavers for obsidian so we have some diagrams in general all we're doing here is moving ideas from adding them relating them going from the new to relating it to the known and then we're going to communicate our own

###### 4

ideas add relate communicate add the new ideas connect to the known ideas communicate your ideas there you have it the arc framework now it's simple but we can add complexity to it because it actually ties into one of the very first things that I shared which is called idea emergence and this is where we have a bunch of tiny Atomic ideas and we can see how they can start to connect and they build into greater things and those things make it very easy to to communicate your value in the world let's keep going now when we look at that there's kind of this inner idea verse which is where we're spending most of our time but there is a broader idea of verse just keep that in mind the world the environment around you does affect your ideas and your idea of verse now where we get into trouble real fast here is that we over collect and when we over collect the core of your creative process it gets squished I I could rail about this for hours I will spare you the time now the problem here though is that when we are

###### 5

capturing and clipping and doing everything that Evernote trained us to do well at we are simply over collecting which means by default we have less time for creating creating is both more fun and is where we create more value for us and everyone around us so let's figure out how we can move from here to something more balanced how do we do that we have to open up that middle space the messy middle relating ideas to each other building off of those ideas getting them ready so we can communicate them even if we don't think we're communicating to anyone I assure you you're communicating to Future you now let's eat go even further you can break this down you have Sparks that come in those can be notes those notes can be put in maps the map can also Spur new notes and through that we can tell stories and that's the arc process if we want to look at Eminem's Arc we can look at his surroundings relationships his home we can see how he used his notes actual yellow notepad notes that he called stacking ammo and how that led to his Communications

###### 6

his way of expressing himself in the world around him pretty cool and then of course we go into more depth with The Arc framework and the link in your thinking Workshop let's close this and get into it so what do you have at your fingertips right now add at any point you can hit command n or control n on Windows and it's going to open a new note new spark so cool right now but oh I have to go to a meeting I have to go sorry uh let me just close this for now how am I ever going to find it again that's what add solves so whoa look at this new spark so cool so automatically we've set up a system where everything that you add all the Sparks that you might capture go to a single place organized by how long they've been alive think of notes as living things when you do that it's going to make a lot more sense why we're connecting them to each other all right so where how is this even working I'm not going to go into too much detail but this would be a

###### 7

great time to look at the folders and see how this unified system works if we troll down the add folder the plus icon you'll see that's where these new notes go here's the one I just created new spark so cool so how about we click on what is an ideaverse and this will give you some context into this thing we've been talking about and I have an assignment for you I ask if you can pause the video right now try to get this done hit command M start typing ideas hit enter and you've just moved this note from the add folder to the atlas under ideas now if you're on Windows Ctrl M so let me see what that would look like right now I'm going to hit command M start typing ideas hit enter and boom it's gone and that's out of AD and it's into the atlas notes and I put it in ideas if that's too much structure for you just throw it in notes and then don't don't have to worry about it again but we don't need the folders you can see how they relate to the links it's a

###### 8

beautiful thing and just so we keep this the way it was I can easily move that that note back into the add folder okay great let's close that and continue on to relate and while we're in relate let's go ahead and close the folders these the folders get in the way half of the time the other half the time they can help organize but for the most part they get in the way the more that we can spend with links the better we're going to be with relating ideas and therefore creating value and valuable Communications so I have two helpful save searches here for you to go with and this looks at any tag that has note boat or note develop so we won't go into the details but what this allows me to do is at any time I can tell future me some of the ideas I want to continue either connecting to other boats out there in the lonely and big wide open ocean or I can start to develop ideas further so great example of this is maybe I'm like ah I've been wanting to develop this note it's here let

###### 9

me start developing it and let's see what I have let's see what I've told myself where I can easily kind of sink my teeth back into it and see what I want to do with this let's go ahead and go back and we can just simply finish by going to communicate now if I didn't want to go back to the home note it turns out that I've not only have up here in the properties but I've also added something else called related and I've already set up so this can work for you in one of the I think it's the most downloaded obsidian plugin called excalibrain by jolt vizian this is a little bit of a detour but it's only like 30 seconds it's really cool so let me go ahead and open up excalib there it is excalibrain let's click on this okay all right now I'm going to drag it over to the right and now let's jump back into relate where we were and what I want you to see here is that we have a little map and so under the properties I've made it and this will work for you

###### 10

straight out of the box if I have related over here it's going to go off to the left like it's a it's a sideways relationship it's not a hierarchical thing right so above though up is where we have the home note and it looks like because of how these things link we also have the thinking map and relate is right there so this is pretty cool if I go ahead and click on ADD we can see a similar sort of arrangement where these three seem to all be related but not in a hierarchical fashion and then we have the whole note right above if you find that cool you'll definitely love to dig into that more it can be a distraction but it can also lead to Great insights and allow you to fly around your ideaverse at really blazing and enjoyable speeds okay now just to finish this off communicate I just gave you a few things here you can look at how I'm tracking some Communications in this idea verse for obsidian example closing this out let's move forward I might just not want to work with ideas when I'm in the atlas

###### 11

I might just want to generally work with kind of longer term knowledge yes knowledge and ideas almost the same thing this is more active this is more of a creative I'm creating something even if it's not a creative field even if I have a report that's due I can manage it this way but there are other forms of knowledge so let's dive into the library starting out you will not need the library you can avoid it so we're just going to fly through this quickly there is a link in your thinking classification system it's based on universal classification systems that already exist cutter Dewey and the universal decimal classification systems all I did was tweak the first two for Knowledge Management and personal management the rest is basically the same this is the only time really I think you'll see me use numbers and I encourage you not to use any more numbers this is just kind of using an existing system I'm not going to go into decimal points or any nonsense like that because it's going to become outdated faster than we think and the utility of it unless you're a librarian or

###### 12

your job is about classifying information it will not be important for you okay so let's close this and we can see very quickly how I'm kind of organizing my high level Maps you know you can think of these as notes mainly about other notes Gathering the links of my other notes you can see Knowledge Management personal management philosophy spirituality and you can go through this on your own time pretty cool it's one way for us to keep track of how we move through the information but you can also get lost in it so let's instead go to the people map depending on what you're doing you may want to track people these could be people in in your world friends and family or they can be long passed away prominent people that's the example that I have for you here you can see that if I click on a note like this one mihai chick sent me hi we can see that he has to tag people and I've also for dates given his dates that he's been alive what's cool about that is then we can sort by that over here and we can

###### 13

see who maybe was born the same year wow how cool is that it's like two people I admire so much being born the same day because of this exact situation it sparked a new idea called the five decade rule we won't go over it now but that is the power of linking your thinking and looking at your information in interesting ways you can't help but generate new insights and those insights can go on to inform your world view and how you communicate with everyone around you now to finish the atlas reminder we are in the home note we're using Ace in the home note we're almost into calendar let's go into the sources map now many of us if you grew up on Evernote if you spent a lot of time capturing and collecting things you might be wondering well how should I manage my sources there's no one-size-fits all if you are clipping like a wild person you probably want to do most of your clipping in a different place sometimes it's called a read it later app other times it's called an anti-library when I know there's something I want to work with

###### 14

that's when I'll make a separate note and make sure it goes into the ideaverse that's when I can connect it to other notes and ideas and start to develop and cultivate the ideas around it that's what takes a book printed on dead trees often from dead people and makes it into something that is alive where you're actually communicating with them and you can make all sorts of new insights that are your own thoughts so what I do here is just there are a few books that you'll notice in ideaverse repsidian and we have a little search that can pull these up easily I also have a movie example let's collapse these we have other things that you can play with and then just all sources so this is just looking at the sources folder okay so this whole awesome Ace headspace what's happening here under Atlas we go into notes and I've just thrown all sources into this simple folder called sources I don't need to organize it any further if you want to you can but I don't need to so what's so neat about that is this is where sources is and because

###### 15

it is a place I go to from time to time I threw a link to it on my customized home note will you throw a link to your sources map on your home note hmm yeah that's right you customize your home note we cover that in the workshop we make sure this is working for you your use case is your profession your interest your hobby your passion okay let's close that now when we want to orient our mind around time where do we usually go that's right the calendar so let's go ahead and twirl this down before I do we can collapse the folder we will not need that for now we can do all this in the home note Ace in the home note a lovely thing so let's twirl this down and the question hey what's on your mind so if you want to capture a journal a thought a spark a log for the day go ahead and along with me if you're on a Mac hit command D if you're on Windows hit Ctrl D it'll open up a very simple daily note with a couple suggestions you can just immediately

###### 16

delete this stuff and do whatever you need to in a daily note um when you're done with the daily note you can close it you can work from it for the day whatever works for you now a lot of people love their daily note and I find it great when I need to dump those fast thoughts and sometimes I'll build a whole daily game plan from there but just as often I want to capture something specific so then I'll go to logs and I have an example for you a couple examples actually I've included idea log and the newsletter so let's go into the idea log these are my personal ideas so basically from an entire year I took my actual ideas that I captured in this log and I'm sharing them with you below so you can kind of see what they look like you can see how they connect to outside URLs and also internal notes now there are probably just about half the ideas I had to redact the other half but it still will give you an understanding of how low-tech an ideal log can be so for example here's one

###### 17

before Enlightenment Enlightenment have Sparks make remarks after Enlightenment have Sparks make remarks and that's built off of like probably a Zen saying of before Enlightenment was it a chop wood carry water after chop wood carry water okay you get the idea so I have an idea and then I just want to capture it here uh please go through this and just get a sense of kind of how easy it can be to to capture ideas consider whale sounds to work too it can be anything but it's in context to time so I can be recall I can recall oh wow that was yeah why was I thinking then yeah yeah and that and that and then I'm off to the races to accomplish whatever it is in my personal or professional life okay that is the idea log now sometimes I go to the calendar because I want to zoom out and I want to plan and review so with this in mind what does that look like I'm just giving you some general ideas of what you can do you can plan your year you can give it a theme you can see for

###### 18

this year my theme is the year of the level up we just wanna we've been trailblazing in in the world of of Knowledge Management and it's really time to kind of lay instead of trailblaze all the way to lay some Foundation some infrastructure along the way so far we've been okay with that but um there's still work to be done I also like to do a yearly reflection and when I'm reflecting I don't know about you but I can't help but start game planning the next year so there's a there are notes for that you'll see none of these are linked but you could just very easily highlight and then hit bracket bracket and now we have a link with a note ready to be made I can go ahead and click on this but I don't want to so I'll just delete that and we're back over here and I'll delete those brackets you get the idea and to finish let's learn more generally about time travel so let's go over to a note called calendar and what I want you to know here is that there are all sorts of things that we

###### 19

can do with the linear movement that we call time it's great to organize and remember stuff you can use it in multiple ways you can read through this faster than I can say it out loud but you can track down old notes by time you can be reminded of Distant Memories even emotionally transport back to an echo of past you whoa now practically you can rapidly capture an idea or a spark you can quickly take your meeting notes even log things that you care about tracking creatively you can Journal get your thoughts out or free write to unstick your mind productively you can plan your actions for the day goals for the week or even intentions for the year and Beyond and reflectively you can review past notes compile previous thoughts and synthesize all these old notes into new insights and Consolidated wisdom notes allow you to time travel it's how present you can receive messages from past you and send messages to Future you whoa but you might be wondering where do all these calendar notes live in the folders right so if we expand all the folders and we look at calendar right

###### 20

here guess what the new note that we just made it's right here and the logs are right here that is Ace both in the folders and in our notes specifically the home note here Ace and Ace a unified system for you for a lifetime whoa and finally when we want to orient our mind around actions where do we usually go that's right efforts that's why I can't wait to cover the last part of Ace efforts and specifically the four intensities of efforts we will also cover where projects in this whole GTD getting things done mindset where that actually fails us and they do fail us when it comes to working with ideas then I'll showcase a simple and intuitive way to manage all the efforts in your life whether they are the type that are clear and actionable or equally as important fuzzy and ambiguous so when you're ready click here to jump to the next lesson and we'll see you in the next one
