you've ever liked any video I've posted and if you like this channel can you do me a quick favor and hit the Subscribe button it helps this channel more than you know and the bigger the channel gets as you've seen the more videos I can do thank you all right the second big benefit of caffeine is impulsivity so what if you uncontrollably change Direction new ideas don't come from being too focused some might call it shiny object syndrome but what do they know and why follow a single Trail when you can blaze 10 at once so the next time someone accuses you of being impulsive and losing focus just wink at them and say I'm not impulsive I'm multi-directional remember fortune favors the boldly caffeinated the third big benefit of caffeine is distractability everyone loves a mysterious figure and nothing says mysterious like gazing into the distance in the middle of a conversation I mean is it the caffeine making you lost in your thoughts or are you just too edgy and cool for those around you the more distracted you appear the more intriguing you become it's the perfect illusion of depth now let's

talk about it the caffeine conspiracy how come no one has put together the obvious caffeine is an alien entity that has plans for world domination I mean think about the mind control it has those who drink it defend it with their honor and they cast suspicion on those who don't and those scientific studies touting its benefits many are bankrolled and supervised by giants like PepsiCo coincidence think again their headquarters it's obviously Starbucks I mean that logo how alien does that look and I'm just saying before your next coffee ask yourself are you drinking it or is it drinking you in the book caffeine Blues Steven treski stated it clearly when he said let me State this clearly a substance that purports to give you energy by stimulating your nervous system isn't giving you anything it's harming you and the hilarious part about that is that you'll never say that about caffeine until you stop consuming it if you ever do here are three bigger benefits of caffeine that I've experienced and that you likely can too number one control suddenly my mind is mine again the weight of every effort feels lighter that means I

no longer have anxiety around not having enough energy in the afternoons or the evenings at any time I want to do work or exercise or create I have natural energy to work with and even if the energy is low because it does dip throughout the day I know I probably just need a little bit of water or food or something more natural and I'll just have natural energy return so I'm going on roughly 21 days without caffeine and I'm curious to see how it'll extend but I'm pretty sure I've kind of returned to my Baseline and this return to being in control goes way further my my work is no longer all-encompassing like on the TV shows I've been on as we rush to put out the latest fire or complete the latest task we'd laugh at ourselves afterwards and we'd say it's not heart surgery but on caffeine it always feels like it is having that raised chronic ongoing level of stress meant that I rarely felt I had the mental space to think more broadly and Loosely now off of caffeine it's like this great fog Has Lifted like the dark whisperings of

Worm tongue have been banished from my thoughts and they've been replaced with the full strength of my true self like foden in Lord of the Rings I'm once more the king of my castle the next bigger benefit of no caffeine is calm I feel it I also can track it too my blood pressure is lower my resting heart rate is 5 beats per minute lower from 54 to 49 BPM even better perhaps is my heart rate variability that's HRV HRV is correlated with having a youthful physiology better sleep quality and less mental stress now over the past year and a half my HRV levels are higher than they've ever been not just by a little bit but by 15 to 20 milliseconds and that's a fairly substantial jump so in actual tangible trackable data heart rate and heart rate variability I've seen a notable Stark difference now there is one caveat here during the first 5 days of being off caffeine my sleep disruptions were a lot higher I'd wake up I'd be calm but I had difficulty getting back to sleep for a few hours now this was because my body was thrown out

of its old equilibrium and it had to find its way back so that process took about 5 days just keep that in mind if you're thinking about breaking up with caffeine that all these benefits just don't immediately happen but if you're looking for immediate ways to reduce your information anxiety you'll definitely want to grab my free email course ultimate primer to linking your thinking the link is in the description below now it's also worth mentioning that my conversations with others they're more effortless I can pay better attention and I get way less distracted so that's the second bigger benefit of calm and the last bigger benefit of being caffeine-free is capability now caffeine is associated with higher levels of productivity here's what's odd though without caffeine I'm getting more of the harder things done more often like what how can that be it's because with the higher levels of Str stress that caffeine induces those hard efforts would more easily send my mind over this emotional Tipping Point where it felt too stressful to even engage with the work so I would seek out distractions you know usually YouTube or Twitter but now for those

hard efforts that need more energy and focus I'm way better off without caffeine I naturally have the energy to do it and if I have to get up for a specific task I'm now not going over that emotional Tipping Point I'm just turning on to the right level it's even in the simple things where I'm feeling more capable like picking up the phone and making a call to my friends and family before I would have to muster up just the right conditions caffeinated undistracted from work which is really rare when you're caffeinated and not anxious about everything else in my life even more rare when you're caffeinated but what about caffeine as a workout Aid some of you might be thinking well you know I like to work out I like to have a little caffeine beforehand and it's true for your highest performing workouts caffeine helps the research no matter who's putting it on will show you that but for me I'm done with these highly competitive college sports long ago so going from that 100% to 110% it's just not worth the crash afterwards but I'll be honest I still felt it was

worth it because being on caffeine kind of convinced me that I might not even have the end ride this roller coaster of highs and lows of caffeine now I'm piloting my own ship and that's not to say I won't ever return I'm curious but a little skeptical of some research out out there suggesting that you can have caffeine on non-consecutive days and it won't build up a dependency I'm very skeptical of that but I'm just being realistic and open I've really enjoyed being off of it I'm going to continue to be off of it I'm just not committing to a lifetime of being off of it I don't want to commit to anything okay where I'm really curious though is how much caffeine do you drink on average or are you already caffeine-free or are you neck deep in caffeine but are you considering maybe winning off of it would you please share your experience in the comments below I'd really appreciate that I'll just say this I'm mostly free from caffeine's clutches and I've Unearthed a version of myself that I kind of like and it's a reminder that true energy isn't going to
