###### 1

imagine finally having a holistic way to manage all the information and ideas you encounter over a lifetime that's the promise of an idea verse but in the process of thinking with one you may start to suspect it's actually making you learn faster remember more and create more inspired work more often now it's a result of linking your thinking note making learning how to use maps of content all of which we'll cover before the end of this email course but now imagine being able to unify working with links and working with folders that's the promise of Ace Ace stands for Atlas calendar efforts each of these headspaces is needed as you think through ideas based around knowledge time and action that's the secret power of the ace headspace it gives you a reliable system for orienting your mind okay so keep that in mind as we dig in you ready okay let's go now when it comes to us thinking through things there are three headspaces that we move between knowledge time action now until the ideaverse they've mostly been invisible like we're all using them constantly throughout history but now we can visibly see all

###### 2

three and even better we can easily move between the three consciously and effectively okay and if you're following along let's go into the home note and twirl down Atlas for now and I'm going to go into ideaverse map since I have home note pinned it opened up in a new tab don't worry about it it's great so we're going to go down to how to customize your Ace headspace are we excited for this or what let's click on Ace folder framework so I open this one up I'm going to make it really big right now so let me zoom in on this oh I zoomed in all the way that's a first Ace is the most universal folder system to help you learn remember and create Ace again stands for Atlas calendar efforts the thing is it's not really just a folder system I just talk about it that way because that's what everyone wants we feel comfortable in folders but Ace is really about the headspaces we use to orient our thoughts around let that sink in and there are just three knowledge time action which map to Atlas calendar cards let's explore this

###### 3

table below just to understand this in a little bit more depth so let's just briefly look at this table you can see we have Atlas calendar and efforts and then how they map to three different orienting lenses where we work with knowledge ideas information all that stuff knowledge time action typically we have an intention when we're spending time around knowledge in the atlas it's typically to understand same thing with calendar when we're orienting around time there's usually a sense of focus whether it's in the present moment thinking about the past or thinking about the future and then we have efforts the orienting lens is action the intention simply is to act this goes on into more depth including organizing principles which brings up the stir framework we are not going to cover that right now if you do want to do a deep dive on your own time go right here and you can learn more so we're not going to go here right now and we're not even going to go into this note until the very end that's where we'll find out how you can use the folders and flex it to meet

###### 4

your needs but for now we're just going to hit the back button going to twirl this open again and dive into how Ace honors the three headspaces of Knowledge Management okay one more repetition knowledge is atlas time calendar action efforts now you may find yourself completely immersed in a single headspace I know who is someone who comes into this world this idea verse from about getting things done productivity grinding white knuckled mindset and you're thinking to yourself I don't need Atlas I don't need calendar all I need are efforts which are kind of like projects I think that's all I need great just go there for now but life is long and the Pendulum will swing will you be ready to go along for the ride here's what I'm talking about you may be spending time in efforts when you find a new interest and you wonder how can you manage all this new stuff coming in maybe it's a new hobby well time to shift to the atlas mindset for knowledge and then you may be spending time in Atlas when you start on a new job like that new hobby that you took

###### 5

on maybe it afforded you an opportunity to try out a different career path now you're in this new job and you have to go from meeting to meeting and take all these notes meeting notes daily notes where do you think those notes go you got it they're time based they go in the calendar easy to think about it that way okay you're getting comfortable with this new job that you're in you're taking a lot of notes you're even synthesizing some of these meeting notes afterwards and it's allowing you Clarity and where you need to go next that means you have a better sense of the next steps and your desired outcomes where do you think that would take you next back to efforts okay are we seeing how this is working Ace acknowledges and supports the three headspaces of PKM we can go into knowledge when we need to in the atlas we can go time based in calendar and we can be very active get a lot done in efforts that pendulum just swings back and forth sometimes it's monthly yearly other times it's by the hour or by the minute all right so

###### 6

let's go to the top and not even with clicking back but related I can go to our next stop ACE also helps you with context switching if you're watching this you're probably aware that every time we switch our context our mental context it burns energy and it takes us a while to get going again we want to minimize these switches we want to be more deliberate with these switches Ace helps us accomplish that let me walk you through a quick example of context switching using the ace framework now when I'm frolicking in the forest of new information it's my natural enthusiasm that's leading the way it's propelling my learning where do you think I'm spending time then in the atlas that's where I'm note making I'm probably doing some sense making some synthesizing and those things might not be urgent but they still feel pretty important to me now however after these long stretches of frolicking around in that Forest the Frolic becomes a March I have some clarity out there's something I want to do I want to share with somebody I have a deadline I have to meet all of a sudden I

###### 7

have more tangible outcomes so I'm going to switch my context from knowledge in the atlas to actions in efforts you got it so then we go into efforts and there are other times though that things are just kind of bombarding me and I kind of feel overwhelmed so I'm either going to journal or free write or kind of reflect on how I got here or I just have to jump into the next meeting and take notes where do I go then where do I go next you got it into the calendar where I can talk with present me past me and yes future me these context switches can happen in the moment hourly daily weekly and Beyond in this way Ace honors knowledge time action equally and it naturally nudges you to remember those spaces that you've spent a little bit less time in and maybe they need a little bit more attention okay and that takes us to the final stop in this lesson how the ace folder framework flexes for you okay let's open up that one what I'm going to do now is twirl down all the folders I don't know if

###### 8

you've seen this from me just yet what I want you to see is in Atlas we have a high level place for high level notes called Maps we have all those micro notes in a folder simply called notes and then we have a few utilities images templates and you know doodads like that what I want you to notice though is in calendar we also have a high level sort of folder called logs and we also have the micro notes for calendar under notes now the same thing repeats itself in efforts we have the micro notes for specific efforts but we also have those macro high level Maps on ongoing simmering and sleeping in a future lesson we're going to go over the four intensities of efforts this is a serious Game Changer I can't wait for this to reach more and more people because I have the feeling that when it comes to working with ideas efforts are going to lead the way forward we are not just going to abandon projects but when we need the space for ideas to breathe our minds are going to think better when we think of them through

###### 9

efforts again that's in a future lesson now you might be thinking to yourself I don't know Nick all these folders that's not for me that's too many folders I want it to move away from folders I want to use links more why are you giving me all these folders well good news this is where you come and bring yourself this is where you can customize it this is basically the Bare Bones template and then you can carve away or you can add to it and I want to show you a little bit of both as a beginner you don't need to worry about copying other people's systems why is that it's because you need to earn your own structure so a beginner all they need is atlas calendar efforts don't worry about those subfolders put bits of knowledge in Atlas put midi notes and random notes in calendar and put you know these project related notes if that's that's probably what a beginner will know calm projects or put them in efforts now the Navigator has more experience with Knowledge Management that means that they've had necessary time to earn their structure beginners don't need

###### 10

what the Navigator has still you notice that now I have three troll Downs just for this sort of Navigator mindset I would be a navigator right now so maybe someday I get to Zen master but I'm not there yet so how does a navigator handle the atlas you'll notice the three main folders Maps notes utilities but what you'll notice this time is that I've kind of made subfolders under notes just so I can kind of group those ideas together for me managing outside sources is important having a place for people where I can honor them and Link them to different things very important I don't need any of these subfolders links to all the hard work for us these days however I just kind of like it I'm a navigator I like it let's move forward How could a navigator use calendar in this case you might have logs and notes like you see on the left and you might have a couple more over time you might have a past year subfolder as I have here for you you might also have a compass where you have these really high level planning notes these

###### 11

planning and reflection notes that's what I do anyways in my main ideaverse what about efforts in this case I really encourage you to even if you're a beginner to try out the four intensities of efforts that you see here along with a folder for all those other effort notes you can learn more about that read this on your own time that is what a navigator can do but if you're feeling overwhelmed and you say to yourself but I'm not a beginner I don't know maybe you're aspiring to be a zen master so let's close navigator let's open beginner and compare it to Zen master and what do you notice is the same so maybe you

###### 12

say all these folders are not for me because I'm so evolved I'm so great with my links I don't need all those folders it's just up to you to decide but that is the flexibility of the ace folder framework and again today we've just been talking mainly mostly about Ace used in folders but you're about to find out that there's a lot more to it let's recap in this lesson we covered the headspace of Ace we introduced the concept we look at how Ace honors these different headspaces of knowledge time and action and we said that maps to Atlas calendar and efforts we looked at how Ace helps us context switch we looked at when we need to be in each type of context and how we can move between those contexts daily weekly monthly and so on and we finish by looking at how the ace folder framework can Flex for you now specifically in this lesson we looked at how Ace works with folders folders are traditional we all have experience with folders that's why we started here today but the beauty of Ace is how it unifies how we think with both

###### 13

folders and links and that's why I'm so excited for the next lesson where we will walk through the home note of this ideaverse and see how Ace is used there to effectively Orient our minds as we launch into our thoughts and efforts all through the power of the link you will even get a basic workflow for the arc framework which is a major part of the big Workshop we run where we help you build and customize your knowledge system so that it will last a lifetime so when you're ready click here to jump to the next lesson and we'll see you in the next one
