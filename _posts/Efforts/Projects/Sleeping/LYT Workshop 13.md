	- The workflow sessions are designed to guide you in customizing your personal knowledge system in two overlapping ways: organization and ideation. 
	- In the first session on "organization", we will use the ACE framework as a model in which you can base your organizing decisions.  
	- In the second session on "ideation", we will use the ARC framework to walk you through various workflows to reliably transform the stuff you encounter into meaningful expressions.
