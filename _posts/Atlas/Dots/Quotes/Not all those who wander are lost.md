This quote comes up again and again as the purest counterpoint to toxic productivity.

## Full quote
> “All that is gold does not glitter,  
> Not all those who wander are lost;  
> The old that is strong does not wither,  
> Deep roots are not reached by the frost. 
> 
> From the ashes a fire shall be woken,  
> A light from the shadows shall spring;  
> Renewed shall be blade that was broken, 
> The crownless again shall be king.”
> 
> ― J.R.R. Tolkien, The Fellowship of the Ring
