 For people who have tried bullet journaling, or are neurodivergent, or who are easily distracted; **First Light, Last Light** has proven to be a simple, doable solution. 

# First Light, Last Light Workflow

- *Upon the first light from your device*, simply type something in your daily note. It can be a word, a sentence, a paragraph. It can pivot mid-sentence into a todo list. All that matters is that your first move at the monitor is an intentional one.
- *Before the last light leaves your device* at the end of the day, go back to your daily note to reflect and drop a couple reminders into the next day's daily note. Nothing calms the mind like knowing it's no longer responsible for holding onto lingering thoughts.

**First Light, Last Light** helps people get it all out of their head and onto the page. They can link out to other notes as needed, and they can feel a sense of control as their mind calms down, knowing all their thoughts are being captured externally. This is less about productivity and more about emotion management. It's one of the reasons so many people prefer their ideaverse to be a blend of personal and professional ideas, because it's all on their mind and they tend to offload everything into their notes to better understand and process it. 

**First Light, Last Light** helps reduce stress and anxiety as people get it out of their head and on the page, which often leads to creative solutions or meaningful insights as a person naturally decides to link out from their daily note to related ideas, concepts, and notes their PKM system.  

For those who want to go further, another benefit of digital daily notes is to ability to track things as varied as mood, weight, gratitude, and even the dreams a person has had and the shows they've watched.
