 A maestro balances the intensity and mix of the music. We are doing the same with our efforts. There are three useful intensities for your efforts. 

- ðŸ”¥ `On`: For the most active efforts & projects
- ã€œ `Simmering`: For back of mind efforts
- ðŸ’¤ `Sleeping`: For everything else (random, done, cold storage, etc)

# Effort Maestro Workflow
Right click on [[Efforts]] and select `Open to the right`

**See to Remember**: See at a glance a truer estimation of your efforts.

- What's active?
- What's missing? 
	- Take a peek into Simmering

**Adjust & Rank**: Quickly prioritize your efforts and budget your bandwidth

- What efforts need their intensity adjusted?
	- Are there active efforts in "on" that need to be moved to Simmering because you don't have the bandwidth for them right now? 
	- Are there active efforts in "on" that need to be moved to Sleeping because you have completed them?
- What efforts need their rank adjusted?
	- Within each level of intensity
- Did any efforts change in scope or scale?
	- Many times ongoing efforts spin out a new sub effort.
	- Many times efforts turned "on" grow into "ongoing" efforts.

> [!key]- Best Practices for Effort Management
> - `On` should be less than 10
> - `Simmering` should be less than 25
> - Their total should be less than 35

There, feel better? 

So what's the secret?

We are taking the condition of "***Intensity***" and making it both visible and tangible. 

When you view your efforts by level of ***intensity***, it allows you to:

- See a truer estimation of your current efforts.
- Effectively prioritize your efforts at a glance.  
- Quickly adjust your bandwidth as needed.

For as much complexity as there can be in PKM, managing efforts ***by intensity*** can give you immediate clarity, calm, and control over your efforts in life.
