- [**Idea Emergence**](https://notes.linkingyourthinking.com/Cards/Idea+Emergence+(defn)) - The process of how the ideas you encounter go from the "nothingness" to the "somethingness"—and how those ideas grow in richness, complexity, and personally meaningful value over time.
- **Architects & Gardeners** - A framework to understanding your current thinking style. Used to troubleshoot sticking points and even to get in alignment with team members.
- **Top-down Thinking** - Starting with structure and a clear destination. e.g. A folder-based framework.
    - PRO: Keeps you on track.
    - CON: Stifles emergent thinking.
- **Bottom-up Thinking** - Starting with a various ideas and connecting them organically.
    - PRO: Allows for emergent thinking.
    - CON: Can feel a little too chaotic at times.

    - PRO: Encourages next level thinking.
    - BUT: Requires learning the technique and being able to balance structure/chaos.

- [**Fluid Frameworks**](https://notes.linkingyourthinking.com/Cards/Fluid+Frameworks) - Any helpful framework, or structure, that helps but doesn't hinder note retrieval and/or idea management. They are adaptable, fitting your evolving needs.

- [**Evergreen notes**](https://notes.linkingyourthinking.com/Cards/Evergreen+notes) - Evergreen notes are focused on a single idea and written mostly in your own words. They naturally accrue more links over time.
- **VLN** - Very Long Note - A note that either by design or by development has become very long. It could possibly be refactored into several smaller notes but sometimes is great as is.
- ---
- [**Refraction Thinking**](https://notes.linkingyourthinking.com/Cards/Refraction+Thinking) - Thinking about ONE thing, through the lens of ANOTHER thing.
- [**Data views**](https://notes.linkingyourthinking.com/Cards/Data+view+notes+(defn)) - Data views are special queries you can add to notes, most commonly by using the Dataview community plugin.
