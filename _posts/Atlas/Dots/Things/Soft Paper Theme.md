 Soft Paper is a customized theme that I've been using lately. 

It's a customized version of the AnuPpuccin theme, leveraging Style Settings and an additional font. I was inspired by a really cool showcase in the Obsidian subreddit that you can find [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/12kfo7j/my_obsidian_setup_after_a_month_of_learning_and/).

## Check out my full YouTube video on Soft Paper

The video takes you through a few install steps, *but* we've included my customizations to AnuPpuccin's theme right here in the vault already. All you need to do is switch themes to AnuPpuccin and my customizations should immediately show up!

The only additional step you'll need to do is download and install the free New York font from the Apple developer website if you're on a Mac.

If you're on a PC, instead of New York, use Times New Roman.

## Cool Aspects
Imagine your favorite place to read a book. Think about how that feels as you cozy up in that spot with your book in hand. That's the feeling I get every time when I open this theme in Obsidian. Soft Paper is warm and cozy. It invites and evokes a certain sense of creativity in me it's like almost writing on paper. It's perfect to encourage a calm and reflective state of mind.

### Testing it out
As I shared in my [[Cybertron Theme]] note, I use **Bold Words** for calling out nouny things (most of the time), and I'll use *italics* for drawing emphasis to words (nothing out of the ordinary there). 

Along with that, take a look how stylized the folders are on the side as well as the softer overall feel of this customized theme. This theme also looks great in both light and dark mode. Give it a try in your theme settings today.
