 Wayfinders are navigational aids. Prime examples are the signage in buildings, on roads, and at airports.

**LYT wayfinders** are another type of navigational aid. They are wayfinders used at top of a note, and used in more than one note. I’ve found the sweet spot to be four.

When used well, you can click between high-level notes with barely any mouse movement. It’s easy and kind of fun because of how effortless it is to fly around these notes. Here is one in Ideaverse Pro 2.0:

Not only are LYT wayfinders effective navigational aids, but trying to make one yourself is a mean forcing function. If you have a bigger set of notes and think it might be helpful to add a LYT wayfinder, prepare to be humbled, challenged…but if you keep going…greatly rewarded.
