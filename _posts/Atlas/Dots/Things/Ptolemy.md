Ptolemy was a Greek guy living in Alexandria, Egypt, where the biggest library in the world was. 

And so what did Ptolemy do? He read...and he looked at the stars a lot. 

All that reading and all that staring at the stars led to something massive. He assembled and created a unified theory of the cosmos called [[Ptolemy's Almagest]]. This text was so good, it was treated as 100% accurate for 1500 years!  

Even after [[Copernicus]] published his heliocentric theory in 1543, it took another century until [[Kepler]] overcame his deeply ingrained beliefs. [[Kepler didn't think outside the box, he thought outside the circle]].
