"This is one of my favourite gags on The Simpsons EVER. At first it was funny, then it became stale, then when they drew it out even more it became HILARIOUS." - Anonymous comment

Popularized by a [gag](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/dictionary/gag "gag") in the 1993 episode "[Cape Feare](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/Cape_Feare "w:Cape Feare")" of _[The Simpsons](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/The_Simpsons "w:The Simpsons")_, in which [Sideshow Bob](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/Sideshow_Bob "w:Sideshow Bob"), already injured, accidentally steps on several rakes, causing the handles to hit him in the face.

I think it's funny to consider, in jest, saying to someone, "Go step on a rake."
