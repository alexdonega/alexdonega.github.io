If you want a healthy and complete network of knowledge, you will want a home note. While this is a bit outside the scope of Ideaverse Pro and more something we cover in the [LYT Workshop](https://www.linkingyourthinking.com/workshop), I can't leave you hanging. Enjoy these tutorials to get your home note set up.
