Everything has a place in ACE. It's the most universal thinking system to learn, remember, and create. 

ACE stands for: Atlas, Calendar, Efforts. These three folders are sandwiched by an add folder `+` and an extras folder `x`. 

To learn ACE, go through each lesson in the [[+ ACE Pack|ACE Pack]].

ACE is a lot more than just a folder system. ***ACE is really about the head spaces we orient our thoughts around.*** There are three. The table below will help provide perspective. 

| Headspace    | Orienting Lens | Time Value | Intention | Organizing Principle |
| ------------ | -------------- | ---------- | --------- | -------------------- |
| **Atlas**    | Knowledge      | Timeless   | To Know   | Space                |
| **Calendar** | Time           | Time-bound | To Focus  | Time                 |
| **Efforts**  | Action         | Timely     | To Act    | Gravity              |

> [!NOTE]+ Test your folder structure slowly
> Do less now. I strongly encourage deferring any "great customizations" for later, and just using the pre-provided ACE framework in the short-term. Why? Because *structure must be earned*, and pre-structuring for an entire day just leads to a fragile building that will break in a week.
