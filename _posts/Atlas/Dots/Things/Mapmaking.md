Maps of content are just notes. But their purpose is different. They help you do three things: *gather, develop, and navigate* your ideas. We call them MOCs for short.

Learn about MOCs:

- [[MOCs Overview]] 
	- [[MOCs are Dialectics]] 
	- [[MOCs are both workbenches and maps]] 
	- [[MOCs encourage flexible non-destructive thinking]] 

Go through a working example of how an MOCs powerfully coaxes out quality thinking:

- [[The 3 Phases of MOCs]]
	- [[Habits MOC - Gather]]
	- [[Habits MOC - Collide]]
	- [[Habits Map]] - Navigate
	- [[The 3 Phases of MOCs, a coda]]

Basically, MOCs are simple, yet new and profoundly powerful. When they "click" for you, wow, you'll feel your mind supercharged new ability for massive ideation.
