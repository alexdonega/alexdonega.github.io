ARC depicts the flow of your ideas across time and space. But it does more than that. It provides a practical framework that empowers you to *reclaim the core of your creative process*.
 
![[How ARC + Basic Idea Emergence]]

ARC is framework for ideation. It's also a mindset and method that breathes life into your ideas. By adding, relating, and communicating, you're not only nurturing your creativity but also building bridges that connect your thoughts to the world—making every idea a stepping stone towards personal and shared growth.

We can't cover too much about ARC here (that's what we do in the [LYT Workshop](https://www.linkingyourthinking.com/workshop)), but in a nutshell: ARC gives ***energy*** to your ideas. Here's a basic workflow:

> [!rainbow] ARC » [[Add]] | [[Relate]] | [[Communicate]] 

When something sparks with you, **add** it to your ideaverse.

When you are ready, **relate** the new thing to other things. In Ideaverse Pro, we can only briefly cover three simple but effective note-making techniques. Even though they are simple, if you habitualize any of them, it will transform the way you interact with ideas.

If you are getting lost or wondering "what's the point" you need to fast-forward to **communicate** and immediately find a way to share your thoughts. If your motivation is lagging, it's usually because there is nothing at the end of ARC to pull the ideas forward. Is this something for work? Is this something you can share with family, friends, or the internet at large? At the very least, challenge yourself to email a sharable draft to yourself.
