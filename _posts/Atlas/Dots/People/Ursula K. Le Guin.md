Guin = GWIN



### Wiki
> Ursula Kroeber Le Guin (; October 21, 1929 – January 22, 2018) was an American author best known for her works of speculative fiction, including science fiction works set in her Hainish universe, and the Earthsea fantasy series. She was first published in 1959, and her literary career spanned nearly sixty years, producing more than twenty novels and over a hundred short stories, in addition to poetry, literary criticism, translations, and children's books. Frequently described as an author of science fiction, Le Guin has also been called a "major voice in American Letters". Le Guin herself said she would prefer to be known as an "American novelist".

For all Neil Gaiman fans: You really need to check-out Ursula Le Guin, who passed away two years ago.

Science fiction is an interesting genre; Most modern examples are either post apocalyptic or paint a gloomy picture about humanity’s future; mostly distopian. It is very rare to find a utopian example.

==Writers like Gaiman and Le Guin do not go the same route trying to speculate about the future of humanity. They write about people, feelings, persona, children growing up, characters maturing, challenges in life etc in a fantastical environment. They talk about people, not aliens. They made me think about who I am, who I want to become.==

They taught me science fiction can be about humanity, in a timeless setup.
