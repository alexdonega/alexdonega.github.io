Although "x" is not a word, it can quickly be intuited. 

- x is a connection. An intersection. 
- x is extra. A place to put the stuff that doesn't need to be front and center.
- X is an intentionally fuzzy placeholder. We don't have to get stuck defining everything in the moment.

In a play: "What is x if not everything? Doth x not mark the spot?"
