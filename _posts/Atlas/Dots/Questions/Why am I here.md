The exact reason you are here is going to be unique to you, but you can improve the clarity of that reason. When you do, you'll be more confident as you work (and play) in your ideaverse.

# Your Four Sensemaking Archetypes

Which are you? 

We cover these sensemaking archetypes in depth during the LYT Workshop because we ask the same question to them that I'm asking you now: ***Why are you here?*** 

Are you here...

- ***...to know thyself?*** Then your active archetype may be the **Inner Guide**.
- ***...to understand?*** Then your active archetype may be the **Synthesizer**.
- ***...to achieve?*** Then your active archetype may be the **Producer**.
- ***...to create?*** Then your active archetype may be the **Creative**.

Here's a simple image to show the differences and similarities:

- **Inner Guides** will gravitate towards the Atlas.
- **Producers** will organize around Efforts.
- **Synthesizers** will want to do more architecting. 
- **Creatives** will be doing more gardening.
