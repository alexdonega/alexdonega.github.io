It's simple. 

When something sparks—meaning it's interesting or important—make a remark. 

That means write about it, mostly in your own words. 

Then link it to another note. 

This creates a habit of connective thinking, an invaluable habit you always carry with you.

It also creates an environment—and ideaverse—that coaxes your own unique thoughts.
