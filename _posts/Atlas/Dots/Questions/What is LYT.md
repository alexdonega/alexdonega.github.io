According to the web, Linking Your Thinking (LYT) is a notemaking and knowledge management methodology created by me, Nick Milo. It's designed to help people create a more interconnected, meaningful personal knowledge system.

Some of the core principles of LYT include:

- Creating connections between notes (linking your thinking)
- Building a flexible system that evolves with your needs
- Using "MOCs" (Maps of Content) to organize related notes
- Maintaining a fluid thinking style that balances structure and flexibility

LYT is especially popular among users of note apps that support linking, like Obsidian, Roam Research, Logseq, and Notion. The approach emphasizes creating an emergent structure in your notes rather than forcing them into rigid folders or categories.

Nick Milo offers courses and resources through his [website](https://linkingyourthinking.com/) and YouTube channel to help people implement the LYT methodology. Many users find that this approach helps them not just collect information, but actually develop their thinking and create new insights through the connections they make.
