Are you drowning in digital notes and struggling to make sense of it all? What if I told you there is a new way to turn the chaos into an automatically organized ideaverse? You can do this by building "Collections" in Obsidian. Collections can revolutionize the way you handle information.

Collections are special notes that have "saved searches" that automagically stay up-to-date. Think of them as "dynamic dashboards".  

### Common collections include:

- Efforts
- Books, Movies, Series
- Ideas: Things, Statements, Questions
- Meetings, People
- Quotes, 

### Collections need four things to work:

- A thing you want to dynamically organize
- Properties you care to track
- A template with those properties
- A saved search to automatically filter those properties for you
