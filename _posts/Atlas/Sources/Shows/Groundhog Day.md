I love these types of movies where the protagonist replays events. It's a kind of two-hour existential simulation.

[Groundhog Day (1993) - IMDb](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107048)

Groundhog Day dances in sync with the Buddhist thoughts on suffering through the stages of [[Samsara]] for Phil Connors (played by [[Bill Murray]]) - Cycle of Birth Death (Cycle of Dragon and Phoenix)

In Buddhism, Samsara is the cycle of becoming driven by our karmic intentional activity. Eventually, through repeating the same day for decades, he accepts his fate, tries less, and gives more. Only then does he break the cycle of Groundhog Day. 

Here's the thing, we're all repeating the same day for decades, and something deep within me feels that just like Phil, we too can slightly break away from the cycle of Samsara by accepting more, trying less, and giving more. But, but, but...I don't know if I want to just yet! 

#garden/question Why is the pull of Samsara so strong? What does Jane English's interpretation of the [[Tao De Ching]] say (it's in the second chapter, in the appended notes section)?

### Phil's Stages
- Disbelief
- Taking advantage
- Risky Behavior
- Boredom
- Suicide
- Rebirth ... accepting of fate ...
- Skill Development
- Care for other
- Eventually, *does not try anymore*, which allows for true participation and enjoyment. Every moment of his day becomes appreciated. Only after Phil Connors gives up trying to "win the girl" by possessing her, can a space open up for true intimacy.

#garden/question How does Phil's journey compare to Joseph Knecht's journey in [[1943 - The Glass Bead Game]]? Or [[Siddhartha]]'s for that matter?

Although the idea of replaying opportunities in life could seem like a gift, it becomes a trap if we becomed consumed by it. This is where each action of ours has consequences. And this is the law of [[Karma]]: Phil makes choices. Each choice leads to a new reality. We often choose the cycle of Samsara and suffering. But the profound existential message is that, even in our darkest hour, even when we are at our lowest point, within that fire of suffering are the seeds of renewalâ€”of Spring. This is a form of the [[Dragon and Phoenix]].

Groundhog Dog will remain the best ever, but I must say that [[2018 - Russian Doll]] is a fresh and intriguing take on the genre. "About Time" is a family-friendly, happy ending version. "The Butterfly Effect" is the not-so-happy ending version.
