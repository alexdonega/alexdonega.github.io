Packs are a major part of modularizing the building and sharing of knowledge. The most important pack included in Ideaverse Pro 2 are the ACE Pack.

This note collects all notes where the `collection` property says `Packs`.

```dataview
TABLE WITHOUT ID
	choice(contains(file.path, "x/Packs"),
		"ðŸŽ’ " + file.link,
	file.link) as "Packs",
	
	about as About
WHERE
	contains(collection,this.file.link) and
	!contains(file.name, "Template")
SORT file.name asc
LIMIT 55
```
