When you have a newer or mostly unfinished map of content that needs some work, you might give it the tag `architect/build`. The following view is sorted by most recently modified.

```dataview
TABLE WITHOUT ID
    "üß± " + file.link as "Notes to build in the ideaverse",
    
    choice(contains(file.folder, "+"),
	    "`" + file.folder + "`",
	    regexreplace(file.path, ".*/([^/]+)/[^/]+$", "$1")
		) as "Parent Folder"

FROM #architect/build 

SORT file.mtime DESC

WHERE !contains(file.name, "Master Key (Architect Tags)")

LIMIT 77
```
