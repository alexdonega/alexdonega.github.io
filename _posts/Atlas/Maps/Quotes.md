This note renders all notes where their `collection` property has `Quotes`, sorted by `rank`.

```dataview
TABLE WITHOUT ID 

choice(contains(file.path, "Atlas/Dots/Quotes"), 
"ðŸ’¬ " + file.link, file.link) as "Quotes", 

join(list(by)) as By, 
rank as Rank 

WHERE contains(collection,this.file.link) and !contains(file.name, "Template") 

SORT rank desc, by asc

LIMIT 77
```

# Inline Quotes

Not all quotes are their own dedicated note, but if you type `quote::` at the beginning of a line, then the following view will render it.
```dataview
TABLE WITHOUT ID
	file.link as Note,
	join(quote, "
	") as Quote
WHERE
	quote and
	!contains(file.name, "Template")
SORT rank desc, by asc
```
