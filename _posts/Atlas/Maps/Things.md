> [!shapes] **[[Things]]** | [[Statements]] | [[People]] | [[Quotes]] | [[Questions]] 

This note collects all notes in the folder `Things`, sorted by last created.
```dataview
TABLE WITHOUT ID
	choice(contains(file.path, "Atlas/Dots/Things"), 
		"ðŸ§© " + file.link, file.link) as "Things",
	length(file.inlinks) as "Links"
 
FROM "Atlas/Dots/Things"

SORT file.ctime desc

LIMIT 77
```

These "things" act as a cabinet of curiosities, each with a story. Consider adding a column for `rank` or even for `tags`.

```
 rank as Rank, 
 join(file.etags) as Tags
```
