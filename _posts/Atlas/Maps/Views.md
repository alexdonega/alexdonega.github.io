"View notes" show auto-updating, dynamic views of custom searches.

This note collects all notes where the `collection` property says `Views`.

```dataview
TABLE WITHOUT ID
	choice(contains(collection,link("Maps")),
		"ðŸ”­ " + file.link,
	file.link) as "Views",
	
	rank as Rank,
	join(mapState) as State
WHERE
	contains(collection,this.file.link) and
	!contains(file.name, "Template")
SORT mapState desc, rank desc
LIMIT 111
```
