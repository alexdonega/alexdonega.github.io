```dataview
TABLE WITHOUT ID
	year as Year,
	"![|60](" + image + ")" as Poster,
	file.link as Title,
	rating as Rating,
	join(list(director, actors)) as People
WHERE
	contains(showGroup,"groundhog day")
SORT rating desc, year desc
```

# MAX Testosterone!
Shows sorted by showGroup of "max testosterone"

```dataview
TABLE WITHOUT ID
	year as Year,
	"![|60](" + image + ")" as Poster,
	file.link as Title,
	rating as Rating,
	join(list(director, actors)) as People
WHERE
	contains(showGroup,"max testosterone")
SORT rating desc, year desc
```

# Adaptations

```dataview
TABLE WITHOUT ID
