This note collects all notes where the `collection` property says `Books`, sorted by `Rating`.

```dataview
TABLE WITHOUT ID
	year as Year,
	"![|60](" + image + ")" as Cover,
	file.link as Title,
	join(list(by)) as Author,
	yearXP as YearXP,
	rating as Rating
WHERE
	contains(collection,this.file.link) and
	!contains(file.name, "Template")
SORT rating desc, year asc

# Books by Category

For those wondering how to take advantage of all those properties that book notes have, here is an example of organizing by `bookCategory`.

```dataview
TABLE WITHOUT ID
	year as Year,
	file.link as Title,
	bookCategory as Category
WHERE
	contains(collection,this.file.link) and
	!contains(file.name, "Template")
SORT bookCategory, desc, year desc
```
