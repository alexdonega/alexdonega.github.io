Space Grotesk is a proportional sans-serif typeface variant based on Colophon Foundry's fixed-width Space Mono family (2016). Originally designed by Florian Karsten in 2018, Space Grotesk retains the monospace's idiosyncratic details while optimizing for improved readability at non-display sizes.



Space Grotesk includes Latin Vietnamese, Pinyin, and all Western, Central, and South-Eastern European language support, as well as several OpenType features (old-style and tabular figures, superscript and subscript numerals, fractions, stylistic alternates). For complete specs see typeface [specimen](https://fonts.floriankarsten.com/content/8-space-grotesk/space-grotesk.pdf).
