The Second Brain Summit took place 2024-10-03 through 2024-10-04 and was put on by Tiago Forte. The goals included bringing together hundreds of people who share an interest in productivity, creativity, and PKM as well as keynotes, deep dives, and events in support of that both with guest speakers, workshops, and social events.

I took a lot of individual notes both digitally and on pen and paper, I'll be collecting and connecting them here over time to see what sparks further.
