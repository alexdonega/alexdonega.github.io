On how value is created...Roman's planting shade trees equals strong society...well, what if we think of our day as a full life. So each each is a full life. Are we planting trees for our Future Self? For the Following Generations of Our Life? This metric for a strong society is the same metric for a strong person. And the reverse is true. Project-obsessed people who lost the joy of thinking will build skyscrapers and urban jungles in their minds, highly efficient but highly overcooked with urban black tops causing heat exhaustion and making life less joyful. %% Could be youtube video %%
