### Working with ideas is hard.  

We have too many scattered thoughts and lost notes. So we abandon the app of the week and search for the next app that will magically solve the chaos in our brains.

### Making leaps of insights with your notes is even harder. 

You know Obsidian is the answer, but you still don’t know how to best use it. It can be overwhelming, and you keep asking, “What if there’s a better way?”

### Obsidian Flight School makes it easy—and incredibly fun.  

Once you master Obsidian, you will astound yourself with what you are capable of. But to do this, you need to get the reps and work on the right stuff. Break the barriers that are holding you back.

# What's inside the vault?

The intuitive and immersion design of OFS means that you are learning INSIDE an actual Obsidian vault of linked notes. 

OFS features four distinct "wings," each helps you fly around your notes faster than before.
