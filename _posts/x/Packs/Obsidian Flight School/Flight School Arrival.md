Welcome to Obsidian Flight School. 

![[flight-school-arrival.jpg]]

Linking your thinking—"LYT"—is powerful. But before you can fully experience that power, you have to feel comfortable in your **LYT ship**—the ship you use to fly around your digital knowledge.

As your flight instructor, I promise that if you take your training seriously, you will become an expert Obsidian pilot. You will be able to fly around your notes with ease and feel masterful at whatever you have to do with your knowledge and ideas.

## Orient yourself 
Flight School is deceptively big. 

- For initial orientation, go to the [[Flight School Arrival]]. (You are here)
- For some extra structure, find the [[Flight School Checklist]].
- For your core experience, go to your **[[Flight School Hangar]]**.
- When you feel lost, get reoriented with the [[Flight School Map]].

Let's walk you through the program. Your training will take place in four separate wings:

- *Basic Training Wing*: Formatting, Settings, Themes, Maneuvers
- *Piloting Wing*: Interface, Textwork, Navigation, Combos
- *Instruments Wing*: Display Panels, Plugins, Hotkeys, Functions
- *Resources Wing*: Actions, Commands, Simulations, Glossary, FAQ

## Did you arrive successfully?
Make sure you did the following:

1. Open Flight School as a separate vault. 
	- That means that you SHOULD NOT add it to your existing vault just yet.
2. Turn off "restricted mode" by choosing “Trust author and enable plugins” to enable the use of community plugins.

## Finish your onboarding
To finish your onboarding, make sure you can do the following things:

1. **Use links to navigate**
	- Try to minimize using the Files tab on the left.
2. **Use the back & forward buttons**
	- We will cover doing this with the keyboard later.
3. **Open notes in new tabs**: 
	- Hit `Cmd-click` (or `ctrl-click` on Windows/Linux).
	- Try it now, but come right back here after: [[Flight School Hangar]]
4. **Toggle stacked tabs**
	- Stacked tabs allows you to see multiple notes at the same time.
	- Hit `Cmd-s`  (or `ctrl-s` on Windows or Linux). 
5. **Scroll sideways between stacked tabs**
	- When you have many stacked tabs, hold `Shift` and scroll with the mouse wheel. (If you don’t have a mouse, you can use a 2-finger swipe left or right on a trackpad.)
6. **Be aware of how to toggle modes**
	- To go from editing to reading, hit `Cmd-e`  (or `ctrl-e` on Windows/Linux). 
		- 90% of the time, you will be in "Live Preview" (where you can type).
		- 5% of the time, you might be in Reading View (where you can see how your note will export).
	- To go from editing to the source formatting, hit `Cmd-shift-e`  (or `ctrl-shift-e` on Windows/Linux). 
		- 5% of the time, you might be in Source Mode (where you can see all the markdown formatting when that is helpful to you).
