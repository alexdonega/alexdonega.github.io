Templates keep things tidy. You won't need them early on, but as you have more notes, they grow in importance, not just because of keeping things clean, but because of how you can effectively search across notes if they share similar information. This is what makes [[Collections]] come alive.

Here are the two automated templates when new notes are created:

- Create a new note, and the [[Base Template (Templater)]] gets applied. 
	- Just type `cmd/ctrl-n`. 
	- Adds three properties: `up`, `related`, and `created`.
- Create a new daily note, and the [[Daily Template (First Light, Last Light)]] gets applied.
	- Just type `cmd/ctrl-d`.
	- Just adds the property: `created`. 

# Templates View

Here are all the templates, in alphabetical order, showing the # of properties they have. 

```dataviewjs
// Get all files from the Templates folder
const templateFiles = dv.pages('"x/Templates"').sort(page => page.file.name);

// Create table headers
const headers = ["Templates", "`#` of Properties"];

// Process each file safely
const rows = templateFiles.map(page => {
    // Safe file link with icon
    const fileLink = page.file.path.includes("x/Templates") 
        ? "ðŸ“‹ " + dv.fileLink(page.file.path)
        : dv.fileLink(page.file.path);
    
    // Safely count properties
    let propCount = 0;
    try {
        if (page.file.frontmatter && typeof page.file.frontmatter === 'object') {
            propCount = Object.keys(page.file.frontmatter).length;
        }
    } catch (e) {
        propCount = "Error";
    }
    
    return [fileLink, propCount];
});

// Render the table with minimal CSS for better spacing
dv.container.addClass("template-table");

// Add minimal CSS to fix spacing issue without making it too narrow
const style = document.createElement('style');
style.textContent = `
.template-table .table-view-table {
    width: 100%;
}
.template-table .table-view-table th:last-child,
.template-table .table-view-table td:last-child {
    text-align: center;
}
`;
document.head.appendChild(style);

// Render the table
dv.table(headers, rows);
```

# All Templates, Curated

I find it most useful to look at all templates by organizing them by ACE, and then also placing associated [[Collections]] right next to associated templates. Let's start with the `+` folder.
## + Templates
Any new note you create by hitting `cmd/ctrl-n` will get a `created` date at the top of the note. That's thanks to how Ideaverse Pro is using the Templater plugin. Want to customize what goes into a new note? Then customize this template: [[Base Template (Templater)]]. But I recommend keeping it as simple as possible.

If you are in a new or old note that doesn't have a base template and you want to add one, here are the three most common options to use:

- [[Base Template]]: Just the basics: `up`, `related`, and `created`
- [[Base Template (with Collection)]]: Includes `collection` property
- [[Base Template (with Tags)]]: Includes `tags` property

## Atlas Templates

These are not full templates, but rather add-ons that you can place inside existing notes.

Note: Add these templates to your Templates folder as needed. If you're unfamiliar with templates, you can review Obsidian's documentation [here](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Templates).
